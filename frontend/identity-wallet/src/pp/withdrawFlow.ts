// Assembling a withdrawal: pick a note, plan the legs, build the witnesses.
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR. Every piece underneath is tested and pinned — derivation, discovery, the state
// tree, the witness, the context, the plan — but nothing joined them, so no screen could drive a
// withdrawal. This is the join, and it is deliberately SYNCHRONOUS AND PURE: everything network- or
// device-bound (the rebuilt state tree, the identity witness, the prover) is passed IN, already
// fetched. That is not indirection for its own sake — `prove.ts` cannot even be loaded outside React
// Native, so a flow that called it directly could never be tested at all, and the one part worth
// testing is exactly this: which note gets spent, and what each leg is handed.
//
// NOTE SELECTION IS A PRIVACY DECISION, not bookkeeping. The circuit spends ONE note per withdrawal
// and returns the remainder as a change note, so:
//   - An EXACT match is strictly best: it produces a change note worth zero, and there is no
//     remainder to track, re-derive or eventually reveal.
//   - Otherwise the SMALLEST note that covers the amount leaves the smallest remainder. Spending a
//     large note for a small withdrawal leaves a large change note whose value is a distinctive
//     number, and every later spend of it carries that shape.
//   - Notes cannot be combined. If no single note covers the amount, that is a refusal, not a
//     multi-note spend — the circuit has no such path, and pretending otherwise would produce a
//     witness that cannot be proven.
