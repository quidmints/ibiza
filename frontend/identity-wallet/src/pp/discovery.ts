// Deterministic note discovery — re-derive all of this seed's Privacy Pool notes by scanning the
// pool's on-chain events and matching against seed-derived secrets. HD-wallet-style recovery: the
// seed alone reconstructs the full balance, with NO server-side note storage. Completes the
// enclave-rooted-notes work (src/pp/notes + src/identity/root): one recovered mnemonic restores
// identity AND every privacy-pool note.
//
// Matching conventions:
//   • Deposit notes  — matched by precommitment (Poseidon(nullifier,secret) == Deposited._precommitmentHash).
//                       This convention is PINNED by PrivacyPool, so recovery is exact.
//   • Spent status   — Withdrawn._spentNullifier == Poseidon(nullifier), or Ragequit._commitment.
//   • Change notes   — chained from Withdrawn events using OUR wallet's withdrawal-index convention:
//                       the k-th withdrawal on a label uses withdrawalSecrets(keys, label, k). Since our
//                       wallet performs both the deposit and the withdrawal, this is self-consistent
//                       (it is a fixed derivation path, like an HD account, not an external standard).
