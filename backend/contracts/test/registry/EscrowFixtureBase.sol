/*
 * The state keeper and the bound documents that every escrow_envelope fixture is proven against.
 *
 * WHY A SHARED BASE. Since TODO.md sec. 2.18 the escrow circuit proves SMT INCLUSION of the
 * document's leaf, so a proof only verifies against the exact registration tree it was built
 * against - same documents, same dgCommits, same binding TIMESTAMP, in the same order. Two suites
 * need that tree: RegistrationWitnessFixture.t.sol, which EMITS the witness, and
 * IdentityRegistry.t.sol, which consumes the resulting proofs. Building it twice would mean two
 * copies of a setup where any silent divergence - a different warp, a document bound in a different
 * order - produces an inclusion failure with no indication that the SETUP is what differs.
 *
 * THE DOCUMENTS COME FROM THE SAME JSON THE CIRCUIT WITNESS DID. `escrow_documents.json` is written
 * by tools/build-escrow-fixtures.js --documents, which takes each dgCommit from
 * register_identity_light_td1's own output. Nothing here invents a document value.
 *
 * (Before 2.18, `_plantDocument` bound a document with `dgCommit = 111` and the proof still
 * verified, because the contract only checked `holderOfDocumentHash`. The leaf VALUE now carries
 * the soundness, so a placeholder commitment no longer passes - which is the point.)
