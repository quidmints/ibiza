# Regenerate the on-chain Honk verifier contracts from the Noir circuits.
#
# Everything this script emits is GENERATED - never hand-edit the .sol files it writes, re-run this
# instead. The only post-generation edit it makes is renaming the top-level `contract HonkVerifier`
# (bb emits that same name for every circuit) to a per-circuit name, so both verifiers can coexist
# in one Forge project.
#
# TWO ARGUMENTS ARE LOAD-BEARING AND BOTH ARE EASY TO OMIT SILENTLY: `--oracle_hash keccak`, and
# `-k <vk>` on `prove`. Omitting either produces a pipeline that still builds, still passes tests,
# and is still wrong.
#
# ZERO-KNOWLEDGE: on bb 1.x - which this script pins - ZK is the DEFAULT and the opt-OUT is
# `--disable_zk`, so this script passes NO zk flag and that is correct. On 0.82.2 it was opt-IN via
# `--zk`, and omitting it silently produced non-zero-knowledge proofs that leak the witness; upstream
# inverted the flag precisely because the old default was a footgun. Older notes in this repo that
# call `--zk` load-bearing are 0.82.2-era. Verify the property either way with:
#   bb prove --scheme ultra_honk --oracle_hash keccak -b ... -w ... -o /tmp/a
#   bb prove --scheme ultra_honk --oracle_hash keccak -b ... -w ... -o /tmp/b
#   cmp /tmp/a/proof /tmp/b/proof     # identical => NOT zk; differ => blinded
# `bb write_vk` takes no --zk (the key is shared); the flavour lives in the prover and the verifier.
#
# WHY THE `--oracle_hash keccak` FLAGS ARE NOT OPTIONAL: the default (Poseidon2) transcript is for
# proofs verified *inside another circuit*. Its proofs do NOT verify against the generated Solidity
# - they revert `SumcheckFailed()`. PP-NOIR-FUSION.md's P0 log found this empirically. Every
# standalone on-chain verifier in this fusion must use the keccak transcript on all three of
# prove / write_vk / write_solidity_verifier.
#
# ⚠️ bb 5.x CLI (migrated 2026-08-01). `--scheme` / `--oracle_hash` / `--honk_recursion` ARE GONE.
# The single flag `-t/--verifier_target` now selects hash AND zk-ness together:
#     -t evm                 keccak + ZK   <- every on-chain verifier here
#     -t evm-no-zk           keccak, NO zk (LEAKS THE WITNESS - never for our circuits)
#     -t noir-recursive      poseidon2 + ZK <- INNER proofs consumed by aggregate_withdrawals
#     -t noir-recursive-no-zk  poseidon2, no zk
# `-t evm` must be passed to write_vk, prove, verify AND write_solidity_verifier. Omitting it on the
# LAST of those silently emits a verifier that disagrees with the proofs - it cost a debugging cycle
# on 2026-08-01, and the failure surfaces only as a forge revert.
#
# ⚠️ EVERY FIXTURE, NOT ONE PER CIRCUIT. `withdraw_identity` alone backs THREE committed proofs
# (withdraw_identity, withdraw_identity_wallet, withdraw_e2e) from three different witnesses, and
# ragequit/title_holder each have a second. Regenerating only `<circuit>.proof` leaves the others
# stale, they keep their OLD byte length, and the resulting forge failures look like a toolchain bug.
# That is exactly what happened on 2026-08-01 and cost four wrong diagnoses. See FIXTURES below.
#
# TOOLCHAIN (pinned, do not drift). These MUST match REQUIRED_NARGO/REQUIRED_BB below - and THIS
# HEADER HAS NOW DRIFTED TWICE. It advertised beta.1 / 0.82.2 while the guard enforced beta.13 /
# 1.2.0; it then advertised beta.13 / 1.2.0 while the guard enforced beta.26 / 5.1.0 (corrected
# 2026-08-02). Both times, following the header got you rejected by the guard fifty lines later.
# **Read REQUIRED_NARGO/REQUIRED_BB, not prose** - the constants are what runs.
#   nargo 1.0.0-beta.26+quid-icefix1   locally patched; see the WHY PATCHED note below.
#   bb    5.1.0          `bbup --version 5.1.0`, installed to ~/.bb - which is NOT on PATH by
#                        default, so `export PATH="$HOME/.bb:$PATH"` or the guard reports it missing.
#                        Do NOT use bb < 0.82.0: bbup's own installer warns of a critical UltraHonk
#                        soundness vulnerability below that version, requiring verifier regeneration.
#                        Do NOT assume `bb` on PATH is the right one - several versions are commonly
#                        installed side by side, and the guard below exists because of that.
#
# NATIVE `bb` NEEDS AVX2/BMI2. It SIGILLs on CPUs without them (TODO.md §1 recorded this against an
# i3-U330). Check with `sysctl -n machdep.cpu.leaf7_features` (macOS) or `grep avx2 /proc/cpuinfo`.
# On a CPU that lacks them, substitute bb.js (WASM) for the `bb` calls - same subcommands.

# TOOLCHAIN GUARD - do not remove. See TODO.md sec. 1 for the full compatibility map.
#
# EXACTLY ONE nargo/bb combination works for this repo. Every neighbouring version fails, and -
# critically - SOME OF THEM FAIL SILENTLY:
#
#   bb 1.2.0 + nargo beta.1  ->  `bb prove` REPORTS SUCCESS and writes a proof that bb's own
#                                `bb verify` then REJECTS ("Sumcheck failed!"). Anyone who
#                                evaluates a bump by "did prove succeed?" will ship a broken system.
#   bb <= 0.87.0             ->  `--zk` is SILENTLY IGNORED under `--honk_recursion`, producing
#                                non-zero-knowledge proofs that leak the witness.
#   nargo beta.22+           ->  compiler ICE ("all function ids should have metadata") on
#                                query_identity / register_identity, with zero regular errors. STILL
#                                UNFIXED UPSTREAM AT beta.26 - which is why the pinned nargo is a
#                                locally patched build and the source carries the BigNumParams
#                                accommodation, so stock beta.26 compiles too. (An earlier note here
#                                said "beta.4+ cannot compile our dependency tree" - that was true
#                                BEFORE the noir_dl_lib migration.)
#
# So this guard is not pedantry about versions - it is the only thing standing between a fresh
# clone and artifacts that look fine and are not.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# nargo is a LOCALLY PATCHED beta.26, and the "+quid-icefix1" suffix is load-bearing.
#
# WHY PATCHED: released beta.26 ICEs (`ice: all function ids should have metadata`) on a generic
# operator-overload impl evaluated in a `global`, which blocked register_identity{,_td1,_light_td1},
# query_identity{,_td1} and escrow_envelope from compiling AT ALL. Fix is 3 hunks turning
# `function_meta` into `try_function_meta`; see noir-ice-repro/noir-fix.patch and NOIR-DL-PORT.md.
# Regression-tested against Noir's own suite: noirc_frontend 2223 passed, 0 failed.
#
# WHY THE SUFFIX: an unmarked patched build reports the IDENTICAL version string to the release and
# would slip past this guard unnoticed - the pin would silently stop meaning anything. The marker is
# added in tooling/nargo_cli/src/cli/mod.rs so that using a custom compiler is always an explicit,
# visible decision.
#
# TO REBUILD IT: clone noir at tag v1.0.0-beta.26, apply noir-ice-repro/noir-fix.patch plus the
# version marker, `cargo build --release -p nargo_cli`, copy target/release/nargo onto your PATH.
# TO GO BACK: the stock binary is saved at ~/.nargo/bin/nargo.beta26-release.bak, or reinstall with
# `noirup --version 1.0.0-beta.26`. The circuits still build on STOCK beta.26 too - the
# `BigNumParams::new` accommodation in noir_dl_lib was kept precisely so they do.
# WHEN THE FIX SHIPS UPSTREAM: drop the suffix, go back to the release, revert the accommodation.

# execute_witness <prover-file> <witness-name> - solve a witness WITHOUT destroying a committed input.
#
# THIS IS THE WHOLE OF TASK 30's UNEXPLAINED `SumcheckFailed()` (root-caused 2026-08-02). Both loops
# below used to `cp "${witness}" Prover.toml` before `nargo execute`, because nargo reads Prover.toml
# by default. But `Prover.toml` IS A COMMITTED INPUT for every circuit whose baseline witness is not
# named `Prover.baseline.toml` - title_holder is one - so that copy PERMANENTLY REPLACED the circuit's
# baseline witness with a fixture's, and the replacement was itself committed (db1df14). Every later
# run then proved the baseline fixture from the WRONG witness.
#
# WHY EVERY SIGNAL SAID "FINE". `bb prove` succeeded. `bb verify` ACCEPTED the proof - it is a
# perfectly valid proof, of a different statement. The vk was unchanged and the verifier bytecode was
# byte-identical. Only the Solidity test rejected it, because its public inputs are hardcoded and
# belong to the real baseline. A proof of the wrong statement is indistinguishable from a proof of the
# right one until something pins the statement.
#
# WHY NOT `nargo execute -p <name>`, WHICH LOOKS LIKE THE OBVIOUS FIX: nargo splits the extension at
# the FIRST dot, so `-p Prover.titleid1` resolves to `Prover.toml` and the argument is DISCARDED
# SILENTLY - `-p Prover.doesnotexist` exits 0 and cheerfully solves Prover.toml. It works only for
# dotless names, and this pipeline's witnesses are `Prover.<what>.toml` across six files including two
# generators. So the flag would have swapped one silent substitution for a subtler one; the guard
# below refuses a dotted `-p`-style name for exactly that reason.
