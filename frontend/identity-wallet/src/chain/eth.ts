// Shared read plumbing for the swap/LP app.
//
// PORTED FROM `SPV/spa/src/lib/eth.ts` (2026-08-16), and the ONLY thing that changed is where
// `rpc` gets its transport. In the SPA that was `window.ethereum.request({ method, params })` —
// the injected browser wallet. React Native has no injected wallet, so the app supplies its own
// provider, and `ethers.JsonRpcProvider.send(method, params)` is the SAME SHAPE as
// `window.ethereum.request`. Everything below `rpc` is unchanged from the SPA, because it all
// went through `rpc` already — which is why the browser coupling was two functions and not a
// layer.
//
// ⚠️ READS AND WRITES DELIBERATELY DO NOT SHARE A TRANSPORT. This one is for reads and may point
// at any RPC. Writes go through `protect.ts`, which pins its own transport to the private relay
// so a broadcast cannot silently take the public path — see the note there.
