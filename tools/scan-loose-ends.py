Surface loose ends from a session transcript AND the code, in ONE pass.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Closing out a long thread on 2026-08-02 took FIVE passes to find everything, and
each pass used a different vocabulary. Findings that were real — a stables leg never wired, a
mapped-but-unexecuted cleanup, an unrotated token, an ECDSA soundness hole — had each been STATED in
a reply and never lifted into a task. Recorded somewhere, actionable nowhere. This script does all
the passes at once so the next close-out is one command.

    python3 tools/scan-loose-ends.py --transcript ~/.claude/projects/<proj>/<session>.jsonl

    python3 tools/scan-loose-ends.py            # code-only scan, no transcript needed

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO, and why you still have to think:

  1. It reports CANDIDATES, not findings. Every hit needs a human deciding "is this booked?".
     **THE BOOKED-FILTER IS WEAK AND YOU SHOULD NOT LEAN ON IT.** Three implementations were tried
     against a real 55 MB transcript (572 passages): substring-on-prose flagged 519 as unbooked and
     filtered nothing; any-word-of-4+-chars flagged 0 and hid everything, because a ~10k-line tracker
     contains almost every ordinary word; identifier-shaped tokens (the current one) flags ~503.
     **The value of this tool is the ENUMERATION, not the filtering.** Read the families you care
     about in full. If someone builds a filter that actually works, replace this note with it.
  2. The transcript scan CANNOT see what was never said. The worst bug found that day —
     `// TODO: NONE OF THIS IS CONSTRAINED YET. FIX!` in vendored circuit code, a signature-forgery
     hole — appears in NO transcript pass, because nobody ever mentioned it. That is why the code
     scan below is not optional.
  3. An absent result is not a finding. See RUN THE CONTROL at the bottom.

  1. RUN THE CONTROL BEFORE CONCLUDING. An absent result proves nothing on its own. Three wrong
     conclusions in one day came from skipping this: "RootValidity is tested" (two suites were NAMED
     after it and neither imported it); "the bisect was superseded" (never checked what it was for);
     "35 verifiers are dead, refs=0" (the LIVE Noir verifiers also scored 0 — the metric could not
     distinguish dead from unwired). Ask: would this measurement look the same if I were wrong?

  2. A DISMISSAL IS A CONCLUSION. "That's a false positive" needs the same evidence as a finding.

  3. LIFT IT IN THE SAME TURN. Every miss that day was already written down in prose and never
     turned into a task. If a finding is stated in a reply and not booked, it does not exist.

  4. VENDORED CODE NEEDS READING, NOT JUST BUILDING. The worst bug found that day was a vendor's own
     `// TODO: NONE OF THIS IS CONSTRAINED YET. FIX!` in a file that had been ported, pruned,
     dependency-bumped and tested — without being read.

  5. READ THE RECORDED EXIT CODE, NOT THE HARNESS SUMMARY. A background task reported "exit code 0"
     for a run that exited 101; a `grep | tail -1` turned "70 passed, 7 failed" into "70 passed".""")
