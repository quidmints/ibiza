/**
 * @notice The VERIFICATION half of the aggregated-withdrawal entrypoint (TODO.md sec. 2.4): given N
 *         withdrawals' public signals and one aggregation proof, establish that a valid
 *         `withdraw_identity` proof exists for EACH of them.
 *
 * @dev DELIBERATELY DOES NOT SETTLE. It spends no nullifier, moves no funds and touches no storage.
 *      Settlement needs `PrivacyPool`'s internals and is a separate, money-path change; keeping the
 *      two apart means this half can be tested exhaustively on its own, and a bug here fails closed
 *      (nothing verifies) rather than paying someone twice.
 *
 *      WHAT THE AGGREGATION PROOF DOES AND DOES NOT ESTABLISH. It proves: N inner proofs verified
 *      against the PINNED `withdraw_identity` key, and their public signals hash to the single field
 *      the verifier exposes. It does NOT prove any of the things `PrivacyPool.withdraw` checks about
 *      those signals - that the state root is known, that the identity root is fresh, that the
 *      nullifier is unspent, that the caller is the processooor. **Every one of those must still be
 *      re-checked per withdrawal by the settlement half.** Aggregation replaces the PROOF check, not
 *      the POLICY checks. Anything less would let a batch settle withdrawals the single-withdrawal
 *      path would reject.
 *
 *      THE COMMITMENT IS THE ONLY LINK between the verifier's one public input and the N withdrawals
 *      in calldata. If `BatchCommitmentLib` and the circuit ever disagree, every batch fails to
 *      verify - which is the safe direction, and is pinned by a circuit-emitted fixture in
 *      `BatchCommitmentTest`.

     *                    without folding twice.
