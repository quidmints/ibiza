/*
 * THE CERTIFICATE PATHS HAD NO COVERAGE AT ALL (sec. 2.18gz).
 *
 * `Registration2` holds the ICAO certificate lifecycle and, until today, NOTHING instantiated it -
 * 56 test files, zero of them. `PassportVerifierRegistry.t.sol` covered the verifier registry; this
 * covers `registerCertificate` / `revokeCertificate`, which are the other half.
 *
 * WHAT IS WORTH PINNING HERE, and it is not the happy path.
 *
 * `revokeCertificate` takes no signature, has no owner check, and is callable by anyone. That looks
 * alarming and is CORRECT: it forwards to `StateKeeper.removeCertificate`, which is `onlyRegistration`
 * and requires `expirationTimestamp > 0 && < block.timestamp`. So the operation is permissionless
 * precisely BECAUSE its precondition is objectively checkable on-chain - an expiry is a fact the
 * contract can read, not a judgment somebody must make. Cleanup of expired state needs no authority.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THAT IS THE PROPERTY MOST LIKELY TO BE "FIXED" BY MISTAKE.** A reviewer seeing an unguarded
 * external revoke will reach for `onlyOwner`, which would reintroduce an authority for a predicate
 * that does not need one. These tests exist so that change fails loudly rather than looking tidy.
 *
 * NO MOCKS: real `Registration2`, real `StateKeeper`, real `PoseidonSMT`.
