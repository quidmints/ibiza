/*
 * THE DSC ADMISSION PATH, DRIVEN BY REAL ICAO DATA (2026-08-03).
 *
 * Every other test on this path uses synthetic bytes - `CRSADispatcher.t.sol` builds attributes out
 * of a counter, and the signer suites use constructed keys. That is right for probing edge cases and
 * useless for the question that actually matters: does this code accept a genuine passport-authority
 * certificate chain?
 *
 * IT DOES NOT NEED A PASSPORT, which is why this test can exist at all. `registerCertificate` is
 * permissionless and proves three things - that a CSCA is in the ICAO master tree, that THIS CSCA
 * signed THIS DSC, and what the DSC's key and expiry are. All three are certificate-level facts.
 * The document only enters one level further on, when a passport's SOD is checked against an
 * admitted DSC (task 6).
 *
 * PROVENANCE OF THE FIXTURE - `test/fixtures/icao_certificate_admission.json`:
 *   - the CSCA comes from `ICAO_ML_20260721154956.ml`, the signed ICAO Master List, whose CMS
 *     signature was verified before anything was extracted (581 certificates, 103 countries)
 *   - the DSC comes from `icaopkd-001-complete-10245.ldif`, ICAO's published PKD feed (31,410 DSCs)
 *   - the pair was checked off-chain first (RSA PKCS#1 v1.5, SHA-256) so that a failure here is a
 *     CONTRACT problem and never a bad fixture
 *   - regenerate the root with `tools/build-icao-master-root.py`, which refuses to run on a master
 *     list whose CMS signature does not verify - "never fake a root" (TODO sec. 2.18k)
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS SYNTHETIC. If any assertion below fails, this repo cannot admit a real
 * certificate from a real issuing authority.
