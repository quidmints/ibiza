// Privacy Pool STATE-tree mirror — the commitment-tree counterpart to postman/identityAsp.ts, and
// the missing half of sec. 2.1 (withdrawal witness assembly). Produces the `state_root` /
// `state_leaf_index` / `state_siblings` inputs that withdraw_identity's main() requires.
//
// Same construction as IdentityAspTree (LeanIMT via @zk-kit/lean-imt, Poseidon from @iden3/js-crypto
// injected as the pluggable node hash), because State.sol builds its tree with the same
// `lean-imt/InternalLeanIMT.sol` the ASP tree uses. Deliberately NOT a second copy of that class,
// though — three properties genuinely differ, and each one is a correctness trap if carried over:
//
//  1. DUPLICATE LEAVES ARE LEGAL HERE. IdentityAspTree rejects an already-admitted leaf as a LOCAL
//     rule. This comment used to say the chain enforced it, via `Entrypoint._admitIdentity` and
//     `aspAdmitted[_holderRoot]` — CORRECTED 2026-08-03: no such function, mapping or ASP tree
//     exists in Entrypoint, so NOTHING on-chain rejects a re-admission. State._insert enforces
//     NOTHING of the kind — it inserts whatever it is given. So this class must not reject
//     duplicates (that would make the mirror diverge from the chain it is mirroring), and
//     `LeanIMT.indexOf` — which returns the FIRST match — is not a safe way to locate a leaf.
//     Hence proofs here are taken BY INDEX, with `leafIndexOf` provided separately and made LOUD
//     about ambiguity rather than silently picking the first hit.
//  2. THE LEAF FEED IS `LeafInserted`, NOT `Deposited`/`Withdrawn`. Both PrivacyPool insert sites
//     (deposit at :140, withdrawal change note at :162) funnel through State._insert, which emits
//     exactly one LeafInserted per leaf, in tree order. Replaying the two user-facing events
//     instead would mean re-deriving the interleaving of deposits and withdrawals from block/log
//     order — reconstructible, but strictly worse: LeafInserted IS the authoritative order.
//  3. ROOT VERIFICATION IS EXACT, AND STRONGER THAN THE ASP TREE'S. State exposes currentRoot(),
//     currentTreeSize() AND currentTreeDepth(), so a rebuilt mirror can be checked on all three
//     rather than on a single isKnownRoot() predicate.
//
// `LeafInserted._index` is the TRUE 0-based leaf index. Upstream PP emitted `_merkleTree.size`
// (post-insert, i.e. index + 1) into a field named `_index`; State.sol:152 was corrected to
// `size - 1` on 2026-07-27, when this file became its first consumer. If you are reading this
// against an unpatched upstream deployment, that off-by-one is live and silent.
