// Pure sanctions-list logic: decode a published export, canonicalise it, build the Merkle root.
//
// NO `//go:build wasip1` TAG, DELIBERATELY. `main.go` is WASM-only because it links the CRE runtime,
// which meant none of the logic below could be tested on a host machine - and this is exactly the
// logic that needs testing. `notary_registry/registry.go` is the same split, for the same reason,
// and this file deliberately mirrors it rather than inventing a second shape.
//
// WHAT CONSENSUS DOES NOT COVER. `cre.ConsensusIdenticalAggregation` requires every DON node to
// produce a BYTE-IDENTICAL result, which protects against a rogue NODE. It cannot protect against a
// DECODER THAT IS WRONG THE SAME WAY EVERYWHERE: every node agrees, and they agree on the wrong set.
// Consensus covers the FETCH, not the MEANING - and the meaning lives here.
//
// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// ADDING A COUNTRY IS ADDING DATA, NOT CODE. There is no such thing as "the" sanctions list: the
// US, the UK, the UN and the EU each publish their own, under their own law, in their own schema,
// with their own idea of what a row even is. The first version of this file answered that with a
// struct, a decoder function and a vocabulary map PER COUNTRY - which makes the fifth country the
// same work as the first, and guarantees the five drift apart.
//
// So a source is now a `SourceSpec` LITERAL - where its rows live, which element identifies one,
// which elements carry names, how the subject kind is decided - and ONE walker (`decodeXML`) reads
// any of them. A new jurisdiction is an entry in `sources` and nothing else.
//
// WHAT THAT COSTS, SAID PLAINLY: element paths become strings instead of struct tags, so the
// compiler stops checking them. Two guards buy that back, and together they check MORE than tags
// did - `validate` rejects an incomplete declaration before any fetch, and `AlwaysPresent` refuses
// any ROW missing an element the real export carries on all of them, where an unmatched
// `xml:"..."` tag silently yielded "" and published a snapshot full of empty names.
//
// THE SIX AXES a register can differ on are TODO.md sec. 2.18cb's, written for notary registers and
// confirmed here against three real sanctions exports:
//
//  1. TRANSPORT   - all three serve a single bulk file over HTTPS. None needed the zip handling
//     `notary_registry` carries, so none is implemented (no-unreachable-code); a
//     source needing it gets a declared decompression step, not a bespoke decoder.
//  2. FORMAT      - XML for all three, so the walker is XML. A CSV or JSON source needs a second
//     walker producing the SAME ListedSubject, not a second everything.
//  3. SCHEMA      - fully declarative below: paths, field names, vocabularies.
//  4. LISTING SEMANTICS - the one that breaks designs. Declared per source, never inferred.
//  5. LANGUAGE/SCRIPT   - names are committed AS PUBLISHED; nothing here folds case or script.
//  6. AUTHENTICITY      - declared per source, and it decides whether the postman can ever be
//     removed for that jurisdiction (sec. 2.18bv). It is a per-country answer,
//     so some lists may be trustlessly anchorable and others not.
//
// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

// Nothing in this file touches the network, the CRE runtime, or a chain: stdlib plus keccak.

// hashes reference "12" with name "3X" identically to reference "123" with name "X", and forbids

// it the same way (sec. 2.18ao); the argument that real data never collides is an argument about
// TODAY'S DATA, not about the construction.
//

// parts for the US, six for the UK, four for the UN. Padding one with empties must not be able to
// reach another's leaf.
//
// THE REGISTRY KEY IS IN THE LEAF, which is what stops a leaf from one list being replayed as proof

// identically, and a proof against the UK root would satisfy a check written against the US one.
