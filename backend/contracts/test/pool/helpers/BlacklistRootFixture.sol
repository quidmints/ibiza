 * here goes stale the moment the fixture generator lists one more - and it goes stale SILENTLY in
 * the worst direction: `withdraw` substitutes the pool's root into the verifier's public inputs, so
 * a stale constant produces `InvalidProof`, which reads as a broken circuit rather than a stale
 * number. The same argument the registration root already carries in IdentityRegistry's tests.
 *
 * ⚠️ ONE ROOT SERVES BOTH FIXTURE SETS. The batch and the standalone withdrawals are proven against
 * separate query lists but the SAME tree, because a pool holds one root: two roots could not both
 * be current, and whichever was not would make its withdrawals unsettleable.
