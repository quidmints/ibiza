/*
 * WHAT A SANCTIONS ROOT COSTS TO COMPUTE ON-CHAIN, PER HASH FUNCTION (TODO.md sec. 2.18db / 2.18ep).
 *
 * 2.18db left the sanctions root's hash open and asked for a measurement rather than a preference,
 * because the two candidates are cheap in OPPOSITE places:
 *
 *   keccak    ~30 gas on the EVM        heavy in a circuit
 *   Poseidon  cheap in a circuit        thousands of gas on the EVM
 *
 * The question became decidable once the tree got a definite in-circuit consumer: a holder proving
 * their document is NOT on the list (2.18ep). This file measures the EVM half, which is the half
 * that could kill the design - `RegistrySourceAnchor._computeRoot` hashes the WHOLE leaf set on
 * every refresh, so the per-hash cost is multiplied by N-1.
 *
 * MEASURED HERE, NOT ESTIMATED, because 2.18db's own figure (32,549 gas) was for a DELEGATECALL to a
 * library and the inlined form is the one that would actually be used.
 *
 * This is a cost probe, not a behavioural test. It asserts only that the measurement ran.
