/**
 * A CRE report metadata header, byte-for-byte the shape the consensus plugin emits.
 *
 * ONE DEFINITION, because two would defeat the purpose. `RegistrySourceAnchor.onReport` reads the
 * workflow ID at a fixed offset in this header, and a test that builds the header with the SAME
 * mistake the contract makes would agree with it and prove nothing. Keeping a single builder here
 * means every suite exercises one layout, and the offset is pinned in exactly one place.
 *
 * Layout, from the SDK this repo depends on (cre-sdk-go v1.15.0 `cre/report_fields.go`, citing
 * `chainlink-common pkg/capabilities/consensus/ocr3/types.Metadata`):
 *
 *   version 1 || executionId 32 || timestamp 4 || donId 4 || donConfigVersion 4 ||
 *   workflowId 32 || workflowName 10 || workflowOwner 20 || reportId 2   = 109 bytes
