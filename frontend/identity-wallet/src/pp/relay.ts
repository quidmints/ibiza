// Relayed withdrawals — the path that lets a user withdraw to a FRESH address holding no ETH.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL. `Entrypoint.relay()` has existed on-chain since the fork, but nothing
// client-side ever used it, so the only reachable withdrawal path was "be the processooor
// yourself". That path requires the recipient address to already hold ETH for gas — and funding a
// fresh address is exactly the linking transaction the pool exists to prevent. Without a relayer
// the privacy model does not close end-to-end: you either withdraw to an address you funded
// (linked), or you cannot withdraw at all. See TODO.md sec. 2.20.
//
// WHAT STOPS A RELAYER STEALING. `PrivacyPool.validWithdrawal` requires
//   proof.context == keccak256(abi.encode(withdrawal, SCOPE)) % SNARK_SCALAR_FIELD
// and `withdrawal.data` is the ABI-encoded RelayData — so `recipient`, `feeRecipient` and
// `relayFeeBPS` are all committed inside the proof. A relayer that alters ANY of them produces a
// context mismatch and the withdrawal reverts. The relayer is therefore trusted for LIVENESS ONLY
// (it can refuse to submit), never for custody or for honouring the fee it agreed to.
//
// The escape hatch survives: a user who is being censored can still set `processooor` to their own
// address and submit directly, paying full gas themselves. That is `buildSelfWithdrawal` below.
