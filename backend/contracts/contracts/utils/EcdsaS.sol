 * @title EcdsaS
 * @notice Rewrites an ECDSA `s` into the lower half of the curve order, for curves whose order is
 *         held as big-endian `bytes` rather than a `uint256`.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (TODO.md sec. 2.18v). `ECDSA256/384/512` accept only low-s - "signatures only
 * from the lower part of the curve are accepted". That is correct for TRANSACTIONS, where a
 * malleated copy would be a second valid transaction, and wrong for verifying someone else's X.509
 * signature: nothing in certificate admission keys on signature bytes, so malleability buys an
 * attacker nothing, while CAs do not normalise. Measured, openssl emitted high-s in 11 of 20
 * signings of one message - so roughly half of all genuine ECDSA CSCA certificates were refused.
 *
 * REWRITING IS SOUND, NOT A BYPASS. If `(r, s)` verifies then so does `(r, n - s)`: they are the two
 * representations of ONE signature and ECDSA verification is symmetric in that reflection, so
 * checking the low form proves exactly the same statement about the same key and message. An
 * invalid signature stays invalid under either representation.
 *
 * `CECDSA256Signer` does this inline because its order is a `uint256`. The 384- and 512-bit signers
 * cannot, which is the only reason this library exists.

     * `s >= n` IS ALSO PASSED THROUGH, and that clause is not cosmetic: a signature made under a
     * DIFFERENT curve can carry an `s` larger than this curve's order, and `n - s` would underflow.
     * Such a signature is invalid here anyway. The equivalent guard was missing from the first
     * version of the 256-bit fix and a wrong-curve test caught it immediately.
