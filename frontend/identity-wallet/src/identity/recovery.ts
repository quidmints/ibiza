// Recovery for the one root mnemonic — the seed every other key derives from.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Until now there was NO RECOVERY AT ALL, and the shape of the gap was easy to
// miss because it looked like a security feature:
//   • `getOrCreateRootMnemonic()` GENERATES a phrase; nothing ever imported one.
//   • The phrase was never displayed, so the user could not write it down.
//   • `WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY` deliberately excludes it from iCloud Keychain and device
//     backups, and `requireAuthentication` ties it to the current biometric enrolment.
// A lost, wiped or re-enrolled phone therefore meant a lost identity and every Privacy Pool note
// gone, permanently.
//
// THE DISTINCTION THAT MAKES A FIX POSSIBLE: the phrase is NOT a non-extractable Secure Enclave
// key. It is a value STORED IN Keychain/Keystore, readable by the app after biometric auth. So
// recovery was a feature nobody had built, not a physical impossibility.
//
// WHY NOT AN MPC / SOCIAL-RECOVERY SDK (Web3Auth, Turnkey, Privy, Para). Every one of them puts a
// share on somebody's server, and most gate recovery behind Google or Apple sign-in — which is
// exactly the deniable-refusal lever this whole project exists to remove (TODO.md sec. 2.22c), and
// a US-operated dependency for the users least able to afford one. It would contradict the
// no-infrastructure and censorship-resistance claims directly. So: a backup the USER holds,
// readable by nobody without their passphrase, and no party to ask.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THIS MODULE IS DELIBERATELY PURE — no expo-secure-store, no React Native.
//
// That is what lets `tools/check-recovery.js` actually RUN it under node and prove the round trip,
// instead of asserting in a comment that it works. The SecureStore-touching wrappers live in
// root.ts, which cannot be exercised off-device. Keep it that way: an import of expo-secure-store
// here silently deletes the only test this code has.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// FORMAT: the Web3 Secret Storage keystore (v3) that ethers already implements — scrypt with
// N = 131072, AES-128-CTR, MAC-checked. Not a scheme invented here. We add no dependency, and the
// file is readable by any standard tool if this wallet ever disappears, which for a recovery
// artefact is the property that matters most.

 * `gethFilename` embeds the same address AND a creation timestamp, and `id`/`client` are a
 * per-file UUID and a version string — all removed for the same reason.
 *
 * MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED: `address` cannot merely be blanked. ethers checks it against the decrypted
 * key and rejects a zeroed one with "keystore address/privateKey mismatch"; DELETING it restores
 * cleanly. tools/check-recovery.js pins both behaviours, because a future ethers that started
