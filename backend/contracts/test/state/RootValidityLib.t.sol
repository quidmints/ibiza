/*
 * THE LIBRARY ITSELF, DIRECTLY.
 *
 * `RootValidityCopiesTest` and `PoseidonSMTRootValidityTest` are named after this library but
 * NEITHER IMPORTS IT - they drive `L1RegistrationState`, `RegistrationSMTReplicator` and
 * `PoseidonSMT` and assert the behaviour through them. So the rule was covered only as far as its
 * three current consumers exercise it, and a FOURTH consumer adopting it wrongly would have been
 * caught by nothing.
 *
 * That matters more here than it would elsewhere: this library exists BECAUSE the rule was written
 * out three separate times and all three copies carried the same defect (an unrecorded root maps to
 * 0, so `0 + validity > block.timestamp` returned true for every invented root on a young chain).
 * The whole point was to have one definition; a definition with no direct test is one nobody can
 * check without a consumer.
 *
 * Each test below names the clause it pins, in the order the library documents them.
