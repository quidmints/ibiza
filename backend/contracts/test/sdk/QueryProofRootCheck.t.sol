/*
 * THE PRESENTATION PATH'S ROOT CHECK (sec. 2.18ae).
 *
 * `AQueryProofExecutor.execute*` take `registrationRoot_` FROM THE CALLER and feed it into the
 * public signals a `query_identity` proof is verified against. That is the sec. 2.18k vacuity shape:
 * a proof is perfectly sound about whatever tree the prover chose, so unless the root is checked
 * against a tree the contract trusts, an attacker builds a one-leaf tree containing an invented
 * identity and presents against it.
 *
 * THE CHECK EXISTS - `PublicSignalsBuilder.withIdStateRoot` calls `isRootValid` and reverts
 * `InvalidRegistrationRoot`. It is not in the executor, which is where one looks first.
 *
 * NOTHING EXERCISED IT. The only harness touching this path, `mock/sdk/ProofBuilderTest.sol`, wires
 * a `MockRegistrationSMT` whose `isRootValid` returns TRUE UNCONDITIONALLY - so the guard was
 * inert in every test that existed, and would have stayed green had it been deleted. This suite
 * uses a REAL `PoseidonSMT`.
 *
 * AND IT IS A FOURTH CONSUMER of the `isRootValid` that accepted ANY root on a chain younger than
 * an hour until sec. 2.18o fixed it - so before today this check was vacuous on a fresh chain or L2
 * even with a real SMT behind it.
