/*
 * PrivacyPoolComplex - the ERC20 pool - HAD NO TESTS AT ALL.
 *
 * It compiled, it inherited everything, and its constructor was changed twice in one day (the ASP
 * registry split, then the revocation registry) without a single test instantiating it. Nothing
 * would have caught a break.
 *
 * What is genuinely UNIQUE to it, and therefore what this file targets, is exactly two overrides:
 * `_pull` and `_push`. Everything else is PrivacyPool, covered by PrivacyPoolSimple.t.sol and
 * WithdrawEndToEnd.t.sol. The two behaviours those overrides add over the native pool are:
 * rejecting native value, and moving the asset by transferFrom/transfer rather than by call.
