# CHECK MEMORY BEFORE SPENDING TWENTY MINUTES ON IT. An under-provisioned VM does not fail cleanly,
# it gets the process OOM-killed - the same trap this project already hit with cargo under Docker.
# HOW MUCH MEMORY, MEASURED RATHER THAN GUESSED. bb's peak is set by the circuit's polynomials
# (2^25 field elements x 32 bytes each), so it does NOT respond to any scheduling knob. All of these
# were tried against a known-failing profile and NONE moved the peak off 11.2 GiB:
#   HARDWARE_CONCURRENCY=2   (bb honours it - "num threads: 2" - and the peak did not change)
#   BB_STORAGE_BUDGET        (no effect; an earlier claim that it halved memory was a false positive
#                             from comparing two DIFFERENT circuits)
#   --cpuset-cpus            (silently ignored - bb reads host CPU count, still reported 8 threads)
#   3 GiB of VM swap         (kernel OOM-killed with 2.7 GiB of it still FREE: the allocation
#                             outran reclaim, so swap does not rescue this)
#   pre-seeding a 2^25 CRS   (bb dies before it reaches the CRS)
# The kernel's own record is the authority: anon-rss:11690980kB, task=bb, global_oom.
#
# 72 of the 75 profiles build in a ~10 GiB VM. THREE DO NOT AND CANNOT HERE - they need roughly
# 13-14 GiB, which is not safe to allocate on a 16 GB host:
#   25_384_3_5_576_248_20_3768_3_2008, 27_512_3_4_336_248_NA, 28_384_3_3_576_264_24_2024_4_2792
# Those three want a bigger machine, not a different setting.

That setting is GUI-only and cannot be scripted. Nothing has been built; rerun when it is raised.
