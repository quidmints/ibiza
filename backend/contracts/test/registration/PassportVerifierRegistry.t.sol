/*
 * THE FIRST TEST OF THE PASSPORT VERIFIER REGISTRY (sec. 2.18gz-signer).
 *
 * WHY IT DID NOT EXIST, AND WHAT THAT COST. `Registration2` holds the only entrypoint that verifies
 * the ICAO chain, and NOTHING instantiated it - 56 test files, zero coverage. Four mention it and
 * only import types. `Registration2Mock.mockAddPassportVerifier` has existed the whole time and was
 * never called by anything: a dead setter on a mock.
 *
 * The consequence went unnoticed for exactly that reason. `passportVerifiers` is EMPTY - no deploy
 * script, no migration, nothing calls `updateDependency` - and `_getPassportVerifier` reverts on
 * zero, so **`registerViaNoir` reverts for every document.** 88 correct, current bb 6.0 verifiers
 * are bound to nothing. A suite that never touches the contract cannot notice that.
 *
 * NO MOCKS HERE, DELIBERATELY. The real `Registration2`, the real `StateKeeper` and real
 * `PoseidonSMT` instances, registered through the real owner-gated `updateDependency` rather than
 * the mock's bypass, binding a REAL generated verifier contract rather than a placeholder address.
 * An earlier draft used `Registration2Mock` and `address(0xBEEF)`; that would have proven the
 * mapping stores what you put in it, which was never in doubt. What is worth proving is that the
 * OWNER-GATED path binds a DEPLOYED verifier under the key the deployment will actually compute.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT PIN: that any proof verifies. That needs a real travel document, which
 * this repo does not have and does not fabricate. This proves the BINDING, never the cryptography.
 *
 * THE SCHEME IS UPSTREAM'S, NOT INVENTED HERE. rarimo's `scripts/utils/types.ts` defines each
 * constant as keccak256 of its own name and `deploy/10_setup.migration.ts` registers each verifier
 * under it. Reproduced here as `keccak256("Z_NOIR_PASSPORT_" + profile)`.
