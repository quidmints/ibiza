/*
 * THE GO SCRAPER AND THE SOLIDITY VERIFIER MUST AGREE ABOUT MERKLE TREES (sec. 2.18at).
 *
 * `backend/cre/notary_registry` builds the notary snapshot in Go; `TitleLedger.registerNotary`
 * checks membership with OpenZeppelin's `MerkleProof.verify`. Two conventions have to line up
 * exactly - sorted pairs at every node, and an odd node PROMOTED unchanged rather than hashed with
 * itself - and BOTH failure modes are silent: a mismatched generator emits proofs that never
 * verify, with no diagnostic beyond a boolean false.
 *
 * Go testing Go cannot catch that; a shared misunderstanding would make the generator and its own
 * checker agree and both be wrong. So the fixture below is produced by the REAL Go generator
 * (`go test -run EmitSolidity` in backend/cre/notary_registry, which rewrites it) and verified here
 * by the REAL library the contract uses. If the conventions ever diverge, this fails.
 *
 * FIXTURE PROVENANCE. Four records, one of them `terminated` so the active filter is exercised, and
 * the proof is for "123 / Jane Doe / Kyiv / active". Regenerate with:
 *   cd backend/cre/notary_registry && GOOS=darwin go test -run EmitSolidity ./...
