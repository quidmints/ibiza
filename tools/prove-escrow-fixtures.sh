# Prove EVERY committed escrow witness and write the numbered fixtures the registry suite loads.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. codegen-verifiers.sh proves exactly ONE witness per circuit (`Prover.toml`), but
# IdentityRegistry.t.sol needs THREE genuine escrow proofs - a single-leaf identity SMT has an empty
# inclusion path, so the withdrawal fixture built on it would hash no siblings and prove nothing
# about the Merkle path. Those three proofs were previously produced BY HAND and committed, with
# nothing in the repo recording the commands. That is the same defect as a test header naming a
# generator that does not exist: the fixtures could drift from the circuit with no way to tell, and
# no way to reproduce them.
#
#   tools/prove-escrow-fixtures.sh          # all Prover.escrow*.toml
#
# RUN IT AFTER codegen-verifiers.sh, never instead of it: the verifying key these proofs are made
# against is the one that script writes, and `bb prove -k` silently produces a proof against a
# DIFFERENT key if the key is stale - a proof the on-chain verifier then rejects with
# `SumcheckFailed()`, pointing nowhere near the cause.
#
# THE FULL PIPELINE, because every step consumes the previous one's output:
#   1. node tools/build-escrow-fixtures.js --documents 3          -> escrow_documents.json
#   2. forge test --match-test test_EmitRegistrationWitnessFixture -> registration_witness.json
#   3. node tools/build-escrow-fixtures.js 3                      -> Prover.escrow<i>.toml
#   4. backend/circuits/codegen-verifiers.sh                      -> verifier + vk
#   5. tools/prove-escrow-fixtures.sh                             -> escrow_envelope<i>.proof/.public
