# ibiza — standing rules

Loaded automatically at the start of every session. `README.md` explains what this repo is and what
came from upstream; `TODO.md` is the tracker. **This file is about how to work here.**

Every rule below was written after it was broken, on 2026-08-02, in a thread that took five passes
to find what one pass should have caught.

---

## 1. Lift a finding to a task IN THE SAME TURN, or it does not exist

The single most expensive failure here. A stables leg that was never wired, a mapped-but-unexecuted
cleanup of 23 vendored files, an unrotated credential, an ECDSA soundness hole — **every one had
been STATED in a reply and never booked.** Recorded somewhere, actionable nowhere.

If you say "worth checking", "still needs", "I didn't", "someone should" — create the task before
you send the message. Not after. Not "at the end". A finding in prose is a finding that dies with
the context window.

## 2. Run the control before concluding from an absent result

An empty grep, a zero count, a passing test — none of these prove anything on their own. **Ask:
would this measurement look the same if I were wrong?** Three wrong conclusions in one day:

- "`RootValidity` is tested" — two suites were NAMED after it and neither imported it.
- "the bisect was superseded" — never checked what it was for.
- "35 verifiers are dead, refs=0" — the LIVE verifiers also scored 0, because verifiers are wired by
  ADDRESS at deploy time. The metric could not distinguish dead from unwired.

The control for the last one was a single command: check whether the thing you claim is alive scores
the same as the thing you claim is dead.

## 3. A dismissal is a conclusion

"That's a false positive" needs the same evidence as a finding. Twice in one day a real finding was
waved away with a plausible explanation that was never checked — and the second time, the dismissal
itself had already been committed to a document.

## 4. Vendored code needs READING, not just building

`noir_dl_lib` was ported to a new compiler, had a module deleted, had its dependencies bumped, and
passed 77 tests — **without being read.** It contained the vendor's own
`// TODO: NONE OF THIS IS CONSTRAINED YET. FIX!` on the ECDSA scalar decomposition: a
signature-forgery hole, reachable, in shipped circuits. No transcript scan could ever have found it,
because nobody had mentioned it.

In a ZK circuit, **every `unsafe { }` is an UNCONSTRAINED prover-supplied value** and needs a
constraint immediately after it. `tools/scan-loose-ends.py` lists them all.

## 5. Read the recorded exit code, never the harness summary

A background task reported "exit code 0" for a run that exited **101** — that is the wrapper's exit,
not the command's. A `grep | tail -1` turned "70 passed, 7 failed" into "70 tests passed". Write
`echo "EXIT=$?" >> log` and read THAT line. Never let a summarising pipe decide whether a suite is
green.

## 6. Never commit an unverified constraint on a money or proof path

A plausible-but-wrong constraint is worse than a documented open hole, because it looks fixed. One
was committed on 2026-08-02 and broke `main`; the fix took three attempts. If the verification run
has not finished, **do not commit** — say the run is in flight.

## 7. Regenerate only what changed

Re-proving unchanged circuits is churn — ZK proofs are non-deterministic, so the bytes differ every
run — and one target (`title_holder`) actually FAILS when re-proved. Artifact generation is a
5-step pipeline; `codegen-verifiers.sh` is step 4 and `tools/prove-escrow-fixtures.sh` is step 5.
Skipping step 5 produces `SumcheckFailed()` nowhere near the cause.

## 8. Another thread may be in this tree

Check `git status` before staging. **Never `git add -A`** — stage your own files by name, and commit
without `-a`, or you will sweep someone else's staged work into your commit. If there is an unpushed
commit that is not yours, do not amend or rebase it.

## Before closing a thread

**⚠️ IBIZA HAS NO TRANSCRIPT DIRECTORY. IT NEVER WILL.** Sessions are filed by the directory the CLI
is launched from, not the repo being edited — and the CLI is always launched from the same place. So
`~/.claude/projects/` contains exactly ONE directory,
`-Users-ricktobacco-Documents-quidmint-SPV/`, and **every ibiza conversation ever held is in it.**

This is not "most of it" or "some of it": there is nowhere else for it to be. Anyone auditing ibiza
from inside ibiza gets a clean result for the wrong reason — the same shape as `refs=0` on verifiers,
a measurement that cannot see what it claims to cover. Sweep the one directory against ibiza's
tracker:

```sh
for t in ~/.claude/projects/-Users-ricktobacco-Documents-quidmint-SPV/*.jsonl; do
  python3 tools/scan-loose-ends.py --transcript "$t" --against TODO.md --root .
done
```

**`--against` is the half that matters most**, and it answers a different question from the families:
they score what the MODEL said and never booked; `--against` scores what the USER ASKED FOR and
never got. A prompt can be entirely unaddressed and never trip a vocabulary family, because its
sentences read as ordinary prose — that is how a design intent stayed unbooked through 454 prompts.
It is a READING LIST, not a defect list: read every row.

## Legacy note

```sh
python3 tools/scan-loose-ends.py --transcript ~/.claude/projects/<proj>/<session>.jsonl
```

Nine vocabulary families plus a code scan, cross-checked against the tracker. It over-reports
deliberately: a false candidate costs a glance, a missed one costs a thread.

## Toolchain

`nargo` here is a LOCALLY PATCHED beta.26 reporting `1.0.0-beta.26+quid-icefix1` (fixes an ICE filed
as noir-lang/noir#13440). The suffix is load-bearing — an unmarked patched build is indistinguishable
from the release and would slip past the guard in `codegen-verifiers.sh`. **CI and other machines
will fail that guard, correctly.** The circuits still build on stock beta.26. Stock binary:
`~/.nargo/bin/nargo.beta26-release.bak`. `bb` 5.1.0 must be on PATH: `export PATH="$HOME/.bb:$PATH"`.
