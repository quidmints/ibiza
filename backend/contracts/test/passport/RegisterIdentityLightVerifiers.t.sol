/*
 * THE FIRST PASSPORT-REGISTRATION VERIFIER THIS REPO CAN ACTUALLY PROVE AGAINST (task 24).
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG, AND IT WAS NOT WHAT THE TRACKER SAID. The debt was recorded as "76 passport
 * verifiers generated on beta.13, in no regeneration script". Those 76
 * `passport/verifiers2/noir/NoirRegisterIdentity_*.sol` arrived in the fork import 0762975, have
 * never been modified since, and are referenced by no contract, test or script in this repo - they
 * are rarimo's, generated from 76 parameterised circuit profiles WE DO NOT HAVE. There is no
 * generator here, so "regenerate them" is not an operation this repo can perform.
 *
 * The real gap sat behind them: the identity circuits we DO have had NO generated verifier at all,
 * and none was in `codegen-verifiers.sh`'s TARGETS. So the registration path had 76 verifiers it
 * cannot use and zero it can.
 *
 * WHY THIS CIRCUIT FIRST. Of the five identity circuits, `register_identity_light_td1` is the only
 * one with a committed witness, so it is the only one that can be PROVEN and therefore the only one
 * whose verifier can be tested rather than merely emitted. The other four (including
 * `register_identity_td1`, which the permissionless ICAO path needs) can have verifiers generated,
 * but nothing can produce a proof for them until a real document exists - that is task 6's block,
 * not a toolchain one. An untested verifier is exactly the artifact this project's rules refuse.
 *
 * FIXTURE PROVENANCE. `test/fixtures/register_identity_light.proof` is a real `bb 5.1.0` proof over
 * the circuit's committed `Prover.toml`, accepted by native `bb verify` before it was ever brought
 * here, generated on the LOCALLY PATCHED nargo (`1.0.0-beta.26+quid-icefix1`) - stock beta.26 ICEs
 * on this crate's dependency, which is the whole reason the patched compiler exists. The three
 * public inputs below are the circuit's own return tuple, copied from `bb`'s `public_inputs` output.
 * Regenerate both together via `codegen-verifiers.sh`; a proof and its inputs are one artifact.
