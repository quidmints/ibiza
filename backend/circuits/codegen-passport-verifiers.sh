# Regenerate the passport registration verifiers (NoirRegisterIdentity_*.sol) on OUR toolchain.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The 76 committed `contracts/passport/verifiers2/noir/NoirRegisterIdentity_*.sol`
# arrived with the fork import and were built by rarimo on **noir 1.0.0-beta.1** (read from their own
# artifacts, not assumed). A verifier is generated from a circuit's VK, the VK follows the constraint
# system, and the constraint system follows the compiler - so those verifiers do not accept proofs
# produced by our patched beta.26. They must be rebuilt here, and nothing did that.
#
# WHY IT WAS THOUGHT IMPOSSIBLE, AND WHY IT IS NOT. Each profile is an instantiation of
# `noir_dl::not_passports_zk_circuits::register_identity` with FOURTEEN generic arguments, five of
# which (EC_LEN, SA_LEN, DG15_LEN, N, plus the exact DG1_LEN) are DER byte lengths of a real
# passport. The file names carry only some of them, and only as 64-byte buckets, so they cannot be
# inverted - which is why this looked like it needed 76 physical documents.
#
# IT NEEDS NONE. Every compiled Noir artifact embeds its own sources in `file_map` for debugging, so
# rarimo's published `registerIdentity_*.json` release assets each contain the exact `main.nr` they
# were built from - the full 14-tuple and the circuit's own `//name` comment, verbatim. The tuples in
# `passport-profiles.json` were read out of those artifacts. No document was used, and none is needed.
#
# THE MANIFEST IS THE INPUT, and it quarantines what it cannot vouch for: three published assets
# embed a DIFFERENT circuit than their file name claims (one is a byte-identical duplicate of another
# profile). Regenerating those from their artifacts would emit a verifier that rejects every proof
# for that profile, silently, so they are held back rather than guessed at.
#
# TOOLCHAIN: the same guard as codegen-verifiers.sh - nargo 1.0.0-beta.26+quid-icefix1 and bb 5.1.0,
# with `~/.bb` on PATH. Stock beta.26 ICEs on this dependency tree; that is what the patch is for.

# BOTH COMPILERS ARE ACCEPTED HERE, AND ONLY HERE, BECAUSE IT WAS MEASURED. The passport profile
# crates compile on STOCK beta.26 as well as on our patched build - that is exactly why the
# BigNumParams accommodation was kept in noir_dl_lib - and the two produce a BYTE-IDENTICAL compiled
# artifact for these circuits (md5 8ea5345bad87c71a45808ae4b6179c99 either way, checked 2026-08-03 on
# 25_384_3_5_576_248_20_3768_3_2008). The patch fixes an ICE; where there is no ICE there is no
# difference. This matters because the largest profiles cannot be built on macOS at all (bb does
# whole-file CRS I/O in one syscall and macOS caps that at INT_MAX), so they are built in Linux
# containers carrying stock nargo. The bb pin is NOT relaxed - a different bb changes the VK.
