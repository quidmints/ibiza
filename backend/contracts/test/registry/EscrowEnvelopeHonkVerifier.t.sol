/*
 * sec. 2.13d/2.13f - on-chain verification of a REAL escrow_envelope proof.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS given no registry contract consumes this verifier yet. A generated verifier that
 * has never accepted a real proof is a liability, not an asset: when the registry lands and a proof
 * fails, there is no way to tell whether the cause is the new contract or the never-exercised
 * verifier underneath it. WithdrawalHonkVerifier spent a whole phase in exactly that state
 * (sec. 2.3), and this test exists so escrow_envelope never does.
 *
 * BOTH FIXTURES ARE READ FROM DISK, and the named constants are CHECKED AGAINST the public-inputs
 * fixture rather than being the source of truth. Hand-transcribing twelve 77-digit field elements is
 * the obvious place for this test to rot: a typo would make it fail for a reason having nothing to
 * do with the verifier. Reading `escrow_envelope.public` and asserting the constants match it keeps
 * the documentation value of names while making drift impossible.
 *
 * FIXTURE PROVENANCE. Both files are emitted by backend/circuits/codegen-verifiers.sh from the
 * committed backend/circuits/escrow_envelope/Prover.toml. Every value in that witness was produced
 * by @iden3/js-crypto and Node's sha256 - the same primitives the wallet uses - and then accepted by
 * the Noir circuit, so this is a genuine cross-implementation agreement rather than a
 * self-consistent loop. That matters most for `dg1_hash`, which must match registration's own
 * digest-packing convention exactly (skip digest[0], read the remaining 31 bytes big-endian); any
 * other packing yields a different field and would bind the sealed MRZ to a value nothing else
 * agrees with.
 *
 * THE WITNESS IS NOT DEGENERATE:
 *   - `ephemeral` is 55555, not 0. Zero collapses the shared secret to this ladder's (0,0) sentinel
 *     for EVERY controller key, making the mask a public constant and the sealed payload readable
 *     by anyone - see pp/src/envelope.nr::test_zero_ephemeral_would_have_leaked_the_payload.
 *   - `sk_identity` reuses pp/src/identity_asp.nr's published vector.
 *   - The DG1 is a full 95-byte TD1 layout carrying a real MRZ, not zeros. TD1, NOT TD3: 95 bytes
 *     is the ID-CARD layout (3 MRZ lines x 30 chars + a 5-byte header). A passport booklet is TD3,
 *     2 x 44 chars, and its DG1 is 93 bytes - a different circuit entirely. See sec. 2.18j;
 *     this fixture carries a passport-style MRZ inside a TD1-sized buffer, which is fine as a test
 *     vector because nothing here parses the MRZ, and misleading if read as a real document.
 *
 * EIP-170: 24,491 bytes with `optimizer_runs = 1` scoped to it in foundry.toml, leaving 85 bytes.
 * WITHOUT that scoping it compiled to 25,503 and was undeployable. Note the cause was the OPTIMIZER
 * SETTING, not the public-input count: this circuit has 11 public inputs and measures 24,491, while
 * TitleHolder has 2 and measures the same 24,491. Verifier size here is essentially flat in input
 * count, so `forge build --sizes` still needs checking after changes, but adding a public input is
 * not the thing to fear.
