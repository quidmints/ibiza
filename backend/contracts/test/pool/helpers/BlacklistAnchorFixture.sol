 * Stand up a REAL `RegistrySourceAnchor` holding a published, activated blacklist root.

 * ⚠️ THE POOL NO LONGER TAKES A ROOT, SO A TEST CANNOT HAND IT ONE. `PrivacyPool` pulls from an
 * anchor precisely so that nobody - including a test - can choose the value. That is the property
 * being protected, so the setup cost here is the property working: to give a pool a root you must
 * publish one the way production does, through `onReport` with a pinned workflow, from the pinned
 * forwarder, and then wait out the activation delay.
 *
 * ⛔ THE EVIDENCE REGISTRY IS THE ONE STUB, AND IT IS NOT THE THING UNDER TEST. `IEvidenceRegistry`
 * is Rarimo's, external, with no implementation in this repo, and the anchor's only use of it is a
 * single `addStatement` on publication. Stubbing a collaborator that does not exist here is not the
 * same as stubbing the mechanism being asserted - the anchor, its workflow pin, its forwarder gate
 * and its activation delay are all real.
