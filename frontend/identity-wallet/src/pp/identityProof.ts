// Inclusion witness for the identity registry - the `identity_*` inputs a withdrawal proof needs to
// show "this identity is registered AND not revoked" (TODO.md sec. 2.13k).
//
// REPLACES revocation.ts. That file fetched a NON-inclusion witness from a separate revocation
// registry, alongside a LeanIMT ASP membership path from identityAsp.ts. Both collapse into ONE
// inclusion proof once status lives in the leaf VALUE:
//
//     commitment -> 0          registered and clean
//     commitment -> predicate  revoked, and the value says WHY
//
// So a single INCLUSION of `commitment -> 0` is simultaneously "registered" and "not revoked".
// There is no state a revoked identity can prove.
//
// NO LOCAL TREE MIRROR, DELIBERATELY - the same rule revocation.ts already established and the
// reason it existed. stateTree.ts and identityAsp.ts rebuild their trees off-chain because those
// are LeanIMTs whose contracts expose only a root, so the wallet has no choice. The identity
// registry is a `@solarity` SparseMerkleTree, and `getProof(key)` is a VIEW FUNCTION returning the
// whole witness. Rebuilding it locally would mean writing a second implementation of a sparse trie
// and keeping it byte-compatible forever, for no benefit. Asking the contract is both less code and
// IMPOSSIBLE TO DRIFT.
//
// (A JS mirror was briefly added here and removed: it needed a three-way validation against
// circomlibjs, solarity and the Noir gadget purely to manage divergence risk that asking the
// contract does not have. The validation passing did not make the mirror worth keeping.)
//
// COMPATIBILITY IS PROVEN, NOT ASSUMED. The circuit gadget (pp/src/smt.nr) is a circomlib
// SMTVerifier port, while the registry is solarity. `test/registry/SmtCompat.t.sol` builds the same
// key set through both and asserts byte-identical roots - including the ZERO-VALUE case this design
// introduced, which nothing had exercised before, since the old revocation registry only ever
// stored non-zero predicates.
