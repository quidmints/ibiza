"""Build and run the recursion TREE that settles a batch of withdrawals on-chain.

  python3 build-recursion-tree.py [N]        # any N >= 2; padded to the next power of two

WHAT THIS IS FOR. `aggregate_withdrawals` verifies all N withdrawal proofs inside ONE circuit, which
is 12,720,801 gates and ~21.7 GB at N=16 - a batcher has to be a server. This builds the same
guarantee as a TREE of two-proof nodes instead. No node is ever large: a leaf is ~1.54M gates and an
internal node ~1.49M, so peak memory is ~2.1 GB no matter how big the batch is. The root is an
ordinary UltraHonk proof, so it gets a generated Solidity verifier exactly as the flat aggregator
does, and the settlement stays trustless.

WHY THE INTERNAL NODE IS NOT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A LEAF, which is the part that sounds wrong. A
recursive UltraHonk proof is 458 fields WHATEVER circuit produced it - proof length is fixed by the
flavour, not by circuit size. So verifying an aggregation proof costs the same as verifying a
withdrawal proof, and the internal node is actually cheaper because it folds one public input per
child instead of seven.

WHY THE LEVELS ARE GENERATED RATHER THAN CHECKED IN. Every level pins the VK of the level below it,
so levels 2..k are the same source with a different constant. Committing k near-identical files would
be a set of twins that drift; generating them means the pin is derived from the artifact that was
actually built, and a level can never cite a key that no longer exists.

SELF-REFERENCE IS AVOIDED, DELIBERATELY. A single "merge" circuit that verified proofs of itself
would need its own VK pinned inside itself. The usual escape is to take the child VK as a WITNESS and
constrain its hash - but then the batch depth stops being structural, and a wrong-but-well-formed VK
becomes a thing the circuit must catch rather than a thing it cannot express. A fixed depth with one
circuit per level cannot express it at all.

TOOLCHAIN: bb 6.0.0-nightly, pinned in package.json and used by default - run `npm install` in
backend/circuits once. Set BB to override. 5.1.0 is no longer referenced anywhere in this tree.

THE TWO VERSIONS ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE AND YOU CANNOT TELL BY LOOKING AT THE KEYS. Measured:
`withdraw_identity`'s recursion VK is BYTE-IDENTICAL under 5.1.0 and 6.0 - same 115 fields, same
values - and its proofs are still mutually unverifiable, failing at `UltraVerifier: verification
failed at reduction step` in BOTH directions while each verifies fine against its own toolchain. So
the incompatibility lives in the proof transcript, not the key, and comparing pinned VKs would say
everything is fine. Every proof in a tree must come from one bb.
