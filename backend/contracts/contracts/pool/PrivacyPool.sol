/**
 * @title PrivacyPool
 * @notice Allows publicly depositing and privately withdrawing funds.
 * @dev Withdrawals require a valid proof of a REGISTERED, UNREVOKED IDENTITY - not ASP approval.
 *      Upstream's eighth public signal was `ASPRoot` and the leaf it proved membership of was the
 *      `label`, i.e. the DEPOSIT (0xbow `withdraw.circom`: `ASPRootChecker.leaf <== label`). Slot [5]
 *      now carries `identityRoot` and the leaf is the withdrawer's identity commitment, proven
 *      included with a CLEAN status (`ProofLib.sol` sec. 2.13k collapsed `ASPRoot` + `revocationRoot`
 *      into it).
 *
 *      SO THE SUBJECT OF THE PREDICATE CHANGED, from funds to people, and this line claimed the
 *      upstream one until 2026-08-07. **Nothing here screens fund provenance.** A holder with a clean
 *      identity may withdraw a deposit of any origin. `Entrypoint` has no admission path at all - see
 *      its ASSOCIATION SET METHODS block - so there is no second check elsewhere.
 *
 *      The `label` is still bound into both commitments (`pp/src/withdraw.nr:80,99` over
 *      `commitment_hasher`), exactly as upstream, so a provenance check remains expressible without
 *      touching the note format. TODO sec. 2.18fa records the gap, 2.18fe the design.
 * @dev Deposits can be irreversibly suspended by the Entrypoint, while withdrawals can't.

    // while keeping the LATEST valid regardless of age, so controller inaction still cannot block a
    // withdrawal.
