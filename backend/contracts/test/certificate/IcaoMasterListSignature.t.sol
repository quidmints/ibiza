/*
 * ICAO'S OWN SIGNATURE OVER THE MASTER LIST, ENFORCED ON-CHAIN (sec. 2.18ci, 2026-08-03).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS THE POINT. sec. 2.18bv concluded that SOURCE-SIGNED DATA removes the trusted publisher
 * completely - stronger than TLS provenance, because a source signature is bound to the DATA rather
 * than to a session, so anyone can verify it at any time with no privileged position in the
 * connection. That design sat blocked because sec. 2.18bw could not confirm that either register we
 * had actually signed its data. **The ICAO Master List does**, and this test is that claim made
 * executable: the contract itself checks ICAO's signature, so a fabricated master list cannot be
 * anchored by anyone - not a postman, not a TSS committee, not an owner key.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT CHEAP, AND IT IS NOT OBVIOUS. The Master List is 876 KB, which cannot be hashed in
 * calldata or in-circuit. But CMS does not sign the content directly: it signs `signedAttributes`,
 * a 104-BYTE structure that CONTAINS `messageDigest = SHA-256(eContent)`. So one RSA-2048
 * verification over 104 bytes yields an ICAO-authenticated digest of the whole list, on-chain, for
 * ordinary gas.
 *
 * THE TRUST ANCHOR. This signer is certified by the UN CSCA whose
 * `sha256(modulus) = 19d41f41...a1f4`, which is itself certificate 0368 of the master list (0389 is
 * its rollover twin, sharing the key - which is why the KEY is the thing to pin, not the certificate
 * and not the name). That chain was verified BY SIGNATURE, because `signerCert.issuer` and
 * `cscaCert.subject` differ as bytes: **an implementation that chains by DN equality rejects the
 * real ICAO master list.**
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT YET DO. It authenticates the DIGEST of the list, not the derived Merkle root.
 * Tying `digest -> root` on-chain needs the 876 KB, so it is either chunked incremental hashing on
 * an L2 or a challenge window. Until then the root is AUDITABLE (anyone can re-derive it from a list
 * whose digest this contract has authenticated) rather than ENFORCED, and saying otherwise would
 * overstate it.
