/*
 * `withdrawBatch` IS FINALLY CALLED BY SOMETHING.
 *
 * WithdrawBatchGuardsTest states plainly that it "does NOT call withdrawBatch" and that the revert
 * paths are UNEXERCISED - it pins BatchCommitmentLib's properties instead. So until this file, the
 * entrypoint had no caller anywhere: not a test, not a contract. Every guard in it was unverified.
 *
 * AND THE FIRST THING CALLING IT FOUND: `BATCH_VERIFIER` was declared and read but NEVER
 * ASSIGNED - no constructor argument, no setter, no deploy script. It was permanently address(0),
 * so `withdrawBatch` could not succeed for any input. A call into an empty address returns empty
 * returndata, which fails to decode as `bool` and reverts bare, saying nothing about the cause.
 * It is now a constructor argument, immutable, with an explicit refusal when unset.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE STILL DOES NOT COVER, so its green is not over-read: the HAPPY PATH. Settling a
 * real batch needs a genuine N=16 aggregation proof (~27 GB to produce, TODO.md sec. 2.4a), so
 * every test below stops at or before verification. Double-spend across a batch is likewise
 * untested. **Do not deploy `withdrawBatch` on the strength of this suite either** - but the guards
 * it does reach are now known to fire, which is strictly more than was true before.
 *
 * The verifier double is the same `NoirVerifierMock` the other pool suites use. Every guard tested
 * here fires BEFORE verification except `InvalidBatchProof`, which needs a verifier that says no -
 * so the double is answering "what does the contract do when the proof is rejected", not standing
 * in for the cryptography.
