/*
 * THE DEPLOYMENT PATH, WHICH DID NOT EXIST.
 *
 * `DeployLib` held SALTS AND NOTHING ELSE - no function in the repo constructed a pool, there is no
 * `script/` directory, and all five construction sites were tests. Two consequences that only look
 * like documentation problems until you try to ship:
 *
 *   1. `BATCH_VERIFIER` had NO path by which a real deployment could set it, so `withdrawBatch`
 *      could never be enabled however correct the contract was.
 *   2. `PrivacyPoolComplex` had never been deployed by anything - its salt was declared and never
 *      used - so the entire ERC-20 path shipped to nobody.
 *
 * This suite exercises the deployment functions themselves, so the path is verified rather than
 * merely present. It deliberately does NOT deploy the identity/state layer: those have their own
 * constructors and suites, and the gap being closed here is the pool layer.
