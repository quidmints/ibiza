/*
 * DEPLOY AND REGISTER THE PASSPORT VERIFIERS — the wiring whose absence makes `registerViaNoir`
 * revert for every document today (sec. 2.18gz-signer).
 *
 * WHAT WAS MISSING. `Registration2.passportVerifiers` is empty and nothing populated it: no deploy
 * script, no migration, and `Registration2Mock.mockAddPassportVerifier` was never called by any test.
 * `_getPassportVerifier` reverts on zero, so 88 correct, current bb 6.0 verifiers were bound to
 * nothing. This is the missing half - rarimo's `deploy/2_registration.migration.ts` plus
 * `10_setup.migration.ts`, neither of which came across with the fork.
 *
 * DATA-DRIVEN FROM THE MANIFEST, NOT AN 88-BRANCH SWITCH. Each verifier is deployed from its
 * compiled artifact via `vm.getCode`, so adding or retiring a profile changes
 * `passport-profiles.json` and nothing here. Importing 88 contracts to dispatch on a name would also
 * push this script past its own EIP-170 limit.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT MUST BE BATCHED, AND THAT IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE. Each verifier is ~24 KB. MEASURED, not
 * estimated: a three-profile window costs 12.9M gas in `test_deployScriptRegistersItsWindow`, so
 * ~4.3M per profile and roughly **380M for all 88** - about 10 mainnet blocks' worth. `START` and
 * `COUNT` select a window; the run is idempotent, so a window may be repeated safely after a failure
 * (re-registering the same key with a fresh address overwrites it with an equivalent verifier).
 *
 * ⚠️ THE KEY IS NOT INVENTED HERE. `zkType = keccak256("Z_NOIR_PASSPORT_" + profile)` is upstream's
 * scheme, recorded per profile in the manifest as `zk_type`, and this script ASSERTS the manifest's
 * value against its own keccak before registering. A mismatch would not fail loudly at run time - it
 * would bind verifiers under keys nothing ever looks up - so it is checked rather than trusted.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT THIS CANNOT DO: prove a document registers. That needs a real travel document, which this
 * repo does not have and does not fabricate. This wires the binding; it does not exercise the
 * cryptography.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   REGISTRATION=0x… forge script script/DeployPassportVerifiers.s.sol --rpc-url … --broadcast
 *   REGISTRATION=0x… START=0 COUNT=10 forge script … --broadcast     # one batch
