/*
 * THE PROPERTIES `withdrawBatch`'s GUARDS REST ON.
 *
 * BE PRECISE ABOUT WHAT THIS FILE IS. It does NOT call `withdrawBatch`. It pins the properties of
 * `BatchCommitmentLib` that the guards ASSUME - that the commitment is order-binding, length-binding,
 * and sensitive to every context and root - because if any of those is false, guards written on top
 * of them are decorative no matter how they are tested.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL UNTESTED, so this suite's green is not over-read:
 *   1. `withdrawBatch` itself - no test calls it. The revert paths (BatchLengthMismatch,
 *      ContextMismatch, EmptyBatch, BatchTooLarge) are UNEXERCISED.
 *   2. The HAPPY PATH. Settling a real batch needs a genuine N=16 aggregation proof, ~27 GB to
 *      produce, so it cannot be made on an ordinary dev machine (TODO.md sec. 2.4a).
 *   3. Double-spend ACROSS a batch - two withdrawals sharing a nullifier. `_spend` should reject the
 *      second, but nothing here proves it.
 * **Do not deploy `withdrawBatch` on the strength of this suite.**
 *
 * WHY NO MOCK VERIFIER. One returning `true` would let (1) and (3) be tested today, at the cost of
 * asserting that the only thing that really matters - does the proof bind? - is irrelevant. The
 * circuit's soundness is established separately and properly by the `rmin` harness (real proof
 * ACCEPTED, valid proof of a DIFFERENT statement REFUSED, garbage REFUSED). Standing rule: never mock.
