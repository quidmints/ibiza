/*
 * A CERTIFICATE REVOKED BEFORE ITS EXPIRY CAN BE REMOVED (TODO.md sec. 2.18ev).
 *
 * UNTIL THIS EXISTED IT COULD NOT BE, BY ANYONE. `removeCertificate` requires
 * `expirationTimestamp < block.timestamp`, so a compromised CSCA stayed usable for every passport it
 * had signed until the calendar caught up - years, for a country signing key. Certificate revocation
 * is the mechanism that CONTAINS a key compromise, and containment was waiting on expiry.
 *
 * KEYED ON THE PUBLIC KEY, not a serial. CRLs list `(issuer, serial)`, but this contract and the
 * circuits both key certificates by `getCertificateKey(publicKey)` - and the ICAO master list
 * carries the certificates themselves, so serial resolves to key OFF-CHAIN and only the key is
 * published on it. That is the difference between this and the sanctions predicate (2.18et): here
 * the identifier exists on both sides.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT THIS IS NOT: authority-free. The root is owner-set, exactly like `icaoMasterTreeMerkleRoot`.
 * The ICAO workflow verifies ICAO's own CMS signature but has no on-chain write path, so both roots
 * are typed in today. This makes revocation POSSIBLE; it does not make it trustless.
