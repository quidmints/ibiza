 * @dev A library for deterministic deployment of Privacy Pool contracts and related components
 * using CREATE2 via the CreateX contract.
 *
 * This library provides predefined salt values for deterministic deployments of:
 * - Entrypoint (as an UUPS proxy)
 * - Simple Privacy Pool (for native assets)
 * - Complex Privacy Pool (for ERC20 tokens)
 * - Ragequit verifier (Honk since 2026-07-27 - see sec. 2.5b)
 * - Withdrawal verifier (Honk)
 *
 * Each component can be deployed with a deterministic address based on these predefined salts.

   * constructed a pool, there is no deployment script in the repo, and every one of the five
   * construction sites is a test. So the pools were only ever built by tests, and
   * `AGGREGATION_VERIFIER` - which `withdrawBatch` reads - had no path by which a real deployment
   * could ever set it. Batching could not be switched on, whatever the contract said.
   *
   * @param _aggregationVerifier MAY be zero: a pool that does not offer batching is a legitimate
   *        deployment, and `withdrawBatch` then refuses explicitly with `AggregationNotConfigured`
   *        rather than calling into an empty address. Passing it HERE rather than through a setter
   *        is what keeps it immutable - a settable verifier could be swapped for one that accepts
   *        anything, which is the whole security of the batch path.
