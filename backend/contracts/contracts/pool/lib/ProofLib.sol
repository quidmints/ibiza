   * @dev Withdrawal is identity-based-ASP (backend/circuits/withdraw_identity), Noir/Honk-proved,
   * NOT Groth16 - see State.sol's WITHDRAWAL_VERIFIER (INoirVerifier). `proof` is the serialized
   * Honk proof (`bb prove_ultra_keccak_honk` output); `pubSignals` is SEVEN slots as of the single
   * identity tree (TODO.md sec. 2.13k) - `ASPRoot` + `revocationRoot` collapsed into one
   * `identityRoot`, and `ASPTreeDepth` disappeared with the LeanIMT identity tree, since the SMT's
   * depth is fixed. Converted to `bytes32[]` only at the verifier-call boundary (`publicInputsBytes32`) since
   * INoirVerifier.verify expects `bytes32[] calldata`, matching every other Noir verifier call in
   * this fusion (see RegistrationSimple._verifyNoirZKProof for the same pattern).
   * @param proof The serialized Honk proof bytes
   * @param pubSignals Array of public inputs and outputs:
   *        - [0] newCommitmentHash: Hash of the new commitment being created
   *        - [1] existingNullifierHash: Hash of the nullifier being spent
   *        - [2] withdrawnValue: Amount being withdrawn
   *        - [3] stateRoot: Current state root of the privacy pool
   *        - [4] stateTreeDepth: Current depth of the state tree
   *        - [5] identityRoot: Root of the IdentityRegistry. The proof shows the withdrawer's
   *              escrow commitment is present there carrying the CLEAN status (value 0), which is
   *              simultaneously "registered" and "not revoked" - one proof, not two.

  /**
   * @notice Converts `pubSignals` to the `bytes32[]` shape INoirVerifier.verify expects, with
   * `context` supplied by the CALLER rather than taken from the proof. A fixed array can't be
   * implicitly cast to a dynamic one in Solidity, so this copies element-by-element - the same
   * thing RegistrationSimple._verifyNoirZKProof already does manually for its own
   * (differently-shaped) public inputs.
   *
   * WHY `context_` IS A PARAMETER AND NOT `_p.pubSignals[6]`.
   *
   * `context` is the only public signal that names WHO GETS PAID - it is
   * `keccak256(abi.encode(withdrawal, SCOPE)) % SNARK_SCALAR_FIELD`, covering the recipient, the
   * fee and the pool. Every other signal is equally true whoever receives the money, so if the
   * proof's own `context` were fed back to the verifier, verification would prove only that the
   * prover once chose SOME context - never that it describes THIS withdrawal. What ties the two
   * together has to come from outside the proof.
   *
   * That used to be a separate equality check in `PrivacyPool.validWithdrawal`, and it worked. The
   * problem was its SHAPE: a comparison is deletable. Remove those three lines and every test but
   * one still passes, the happy path still works, and the binding between a proof and its recipient
   * is gone with no symptom - the worst kind of regression, because the code that remains looks
   * complete. Passing the derived value as an ARGUMENT removes that failure mode by construction:
   * the verifier cannot be called without a context, so there is no line whose deletion silently
   * weakens anything. Delete the derivation and the contract does not compile.
   *
   * The admission set is unchanged. A proof made for this withdrawal has `pubSignals[6] ==
   * context_` and verifies exactly as before; one made for a different withdrawal now fails inside
   * the verifier instead of at a preceding `require`.
   *
