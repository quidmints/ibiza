     *      the registry in the meantime. Inaction and a contested change both leave publication
     *      running on the previous address.
     *
     * @dev THE STORED SLOT SETTLES ITSELF, so there is no promotion call and nothing to forget.
     *      `onReport` folds an elapsed change into `forwarder` the first time the new address
     *      publishes - the gas falls on the party that benefits. An earlier version had a separate
     *      permissionless `promoteForwarder` with two error types of its own, for a job the
     *      publication path already passes through.
     *
     * @dev ⚠️ ZERO UNTIL THE FIRST `setForwarder`, and `onReport` compares unconditionally, so an
     *      unset forwarder accepts NOBODY - fail-closed, and stricter than Chainlink's template,
     *      which accepts EVERY caller while unset. The first set takes effect immediately (see
     *      `setForwarder`); every one after it is timelocked.
