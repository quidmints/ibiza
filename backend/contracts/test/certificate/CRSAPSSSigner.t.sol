/*
 * THE FIRST TEST OF THE ICAO SIGNATURE PATH (TODO.md sec. 2.18l).
 *
 * `Registration2.registerCertificate` admits a DSC into `certificatesSmt` - the tree
 * `register_identity` proves membership in - only after this contract verifies a CSCA's signature
 * over the DSC's signed attributes. So every document that can ever enrol permissionlessly passes
 * through `verifyICAOSignature`, and it had no tests.
 *
 * THE VECTOR IS REAL AND REPRODUCIBLE, not a fixture from our own code. Generated with openssl and
 * independently verified by it before being pasted here:
 *
 *   openssl genrsa -out rsa.pem 2048
 *   openssl dgst -sha256 -sigopt rsa_padding_mode:pss -sigopt rsa_pss_saltlen:32 \
 *     -sign rsa.pem -out sig.bin msg.bin
 *   openssl dgst -sha256 -sigopt rsa_padding_mode:pss -sigopt rsa_pss_saltlen:32 \
 *     -verify rsa.pub.pem -signature sig.bin msg.bin        # -> Verified OK
 *
 * That matters more than convenience: a vector produced by the contract under test would only prove
 * self-consistency. This one proves the contract agrees with a reference implementation about what
 * RSASSA-PSS with SHA-256 and a 32-byte salt means.
 *
 * NO PASSPORT NEEDED. This half of the chain is signature verification, nothing more - which is why
 * it can be tested today while the enrolment path it feeds still waits on a real document.
 *
 * WRITING THIS TEST FOUND A BUG IN @solarity/solidity-lib (TODO.md sec. 2.18s). `RSASSAPSS._pss`
 * read the modulus's LAST byte to count leading zero bits, where a big-endian modulus keeps its
 * most significant byte FIRST - so `sigBits_` was wrong whenever that last byte was under 0x80, and
 * roughly HALF of all valid signatures were rejected, chosen by an irrelevant property of the key.
 * The vector below has a modulus ending 0x41 and was rejected before the fix; four further keys
 * ending 0x85/0x99/0xeb/0xff were accepted. That is why this vector, specifically, is the committed
 * one - it is the half of the keyspace the bug used to break.
