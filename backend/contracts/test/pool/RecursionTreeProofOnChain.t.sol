/*
 * A SIXTEEN-WITHDRAWAL BATCH SETTLED FROM A RECURSION TREE, VERIFIED ON-CHAIN (2026-08-04).
 *
 * WHAT THIS EXISTS TO SHOW. `AggregationProofOnChain.t.sol` verifies the FLAT design: one circuit
 * that verifies all sixteen withdrawal proofs at once, 12,720,801 gates and ~21.7 GB to prove. That
 * cost is why the batcher has to be a server. This verifies the same batch produced by a TREE of
 * two-proof nodes - fifteen of them, none larger than ~1.54M gates, ~2.1 GB peak - and the point is
 * that the thing arriving on-chain is indistinguishable in kind: an ordinary UltraHonk proof with
 * ONE public input, checked by a generated Solidity verifier.
 *
 * SO THE TRADE IS NOT "cheap prover OR trustless settlement". Both designs settle trustlessly; they
 * differ only in what the batcher needs to own.
 *
 * WHAT THE FIXTURE IS. Sixteen GENUINELY DIFFERENT withdrawals - distinct notes, values, leaf
 * indices, change notes and contexts, one per GENUINE registered identity (sixteen of them, each a
 * real `register` with its own escrow proof) - all against ONE state root and ONE identity root,
 * from `tools/build-fold-witnesses.js`. This matters more than it sounds:
 * the older N=16 aggregation fixture was sixteen IDENTICAL copies of one withdrawal, and a fold over
 * sixteen copies of X cannot be told apart from one that keeps only the last X. Regenerate with:
 *
 *   cd frontend/identity-wallet && npm run build:pp
 *   node tools/build-fold-witnesses.js --build frontend/identity-wallet/build --count 16
 *   cd backend/circuits && python3 build-recursion-tree.py 16
 *
 * TWO DEPTHS ARE DEPLOYED, 16 and 32, because verification gas depends on which TREE settled a batch
 * and not on how full it was. A batch settles at the smallest tree that fits it, so a quiet period
 * costs a depth-4 verification instead of waiting to fill a depth-5.
 *
 * THE ROOT COMMITMENT IS A TREE HASH, not the flat keccak `BatchCommitmentLib` currently computes.
 * Each leaf commits to its two withdrawals' fourteen signals; each internal node commits to
 * `keccak(left ++ right)`. Nothing on-chain recomputes that yet - `BatchCommitmentLib` still folds
 * flat - so this file tests the VERIFIER, not settlement. That move is a money-path change and gets
 * its own run.
