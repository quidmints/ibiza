/**
 * @title IdentityRegistry
 * @notice The SINGLE identity tree (TODO.md sec. 2.13k). Key is the escrow commitment; the VALUE
 *         carries status: `0` = registered and clean, non-zero = the revocation predicate.
 *
 * WHY ONE TREE AND NOT TWO. A withdrawal used to prove ASP inclusion of `holder_root` AND
 * non-inclusion of the same value in a separate revocation tree. Encoding status in the value lets a
 * SINGLE INCLUSION PROOF of `commitment -> 0` do both jobs, which removes 43% of the withdrawal
 * circuit (43,772 -> 24,812 ACIR opcodes, measured). It also removes `sk_identity` from the
 * withdrawal entirely: identity is proven ONCE, at escrow.
 *
 * ONE CONTROLLER for this list and the label list alike - a single party decides both, so splitting
 * the authority across contracts would have been a fiction.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE TRAPS THIS DESIGN CREATES, AND WHERE EACH IS CLOSED. Merging two trees with OPPOSITE
 * semantics surrenders structural protections the split gave for free, so each is now an explicit
 * guard with a test rather than a property of the shape.
 *
 * 1. ROOT EXPIRY IS MANDATORY HERE, where an inclusion-only tree would need none.
 *    An inclusion tree is safe to prove against forever - an old root has FEWER members, so a
 *    stale root can only ever under-approve. This tree also carries REVOCATIONS, and an old root
 *    has fewer of THOSE, so a revoked identity could prove `commitment -> 0` against a
 *    pre-revocation root FOREVER. `isValidRoot` therefore enforces MAX_ROOT_AGE, with the latest
 *    root always valid so inaction stays harmless.
 *
 * 2. A ZERO PREDICATE WOULD REVOKE SOMEONE INTO CLEANLINESS.
 *    Zero IS the clean sentinel. `revoke` rejects a zero predicate outright.
 *
 * 3. `remove` MUST NEVER BE REACHABLE.
 *    The solarity Bytes32SMT offers `add`, `update` AND `remove`. Removing a registration is
 *    censorship by erasure - the "postman can drop an existing member" failure the append-only
 *    design exists to prevent. Only `add` and `update` are called anywhere in this file.
 *
 * 4. TWO WRITERS ON ONE TREE.
 *    `register` is PERMISSIONLESS (gated by a proof, not a role); `revoke` is controller-only.
 *    Both paths are single-purpose and neither can perform the other's write.
 *
 * 5. AN ESCROW PROOF DOES NOT PROVE THE PASSPORT IS REAL - and this is the subtlest of them.
 *    `escrow_envelope` proves knowledge of an MRZ and of the `sk_identity` it belongs to. It CANNOT
 *    prove the document is genuine, because the ICAO signature chain is verified during
 *    REGISTRATION. Taken alone, a caller could invent an MRZ, escrow against it and land a
 *    commitment backed by nothing - making the tree's scarcity guarantee, and therefore the whole
 *    blacklist, worthless.
 *
 *    CLOSED IN-CIRCUIT SINCE sec. 2.18, NOT HERE. The circuit proves SMT inclusion of the document's
 *    own leaf in `StateKeeper.registrationSmt`; this contract's only remaining job is to confirm the
 *    root that inclusion was proven against is one the SMT actually recognises. See `register`.
 *
 * 6. A REVOKED IDENTITY COULD SIMPLY REGISTER AGAIN (sec. 2.18a).
 *    There is no per-holder guard on this contract and there cannot easily be one: `holderRoot` is
 *    no longer published, by design. The guard is that `commitment` is a FUNCTION of `sk_identity`,
 *    fixed in-circuit, so one identity has exactly one commitment and `registered[commitment]`
 *    rejects the second attempt. While the escrowed secret was freely chosen, anyone revoked could
 *    escrow a fresh secret against the same passport and come back clean.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * NON-UPGRADEABLE and UNOWNED, for the reasons the RevocationRegistry it replaces was: an upgradeable identity
 * gate is a mutable one with extra steps.
