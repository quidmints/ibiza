/*
 * THE CIRCUITS AND THE CONTRACT MUST AGREE ABOUT THE BATCH COMMITMENT (TODO.md sec. 2.4 / 2.18el).
 *
 * The tree's root verifier exposes ONE public input - the root - so this recomputation is the only
 * thing tying that field back to the individual withdrawals a batch settles. If the two
 * implementations diverge, nothing says so: the circuits prove happily, the contract recomputes
 * happily, and they produce different field elements.
 *
 * THIS TEST ONCE HELD A FROZEN CONSTANT AND SLEPT THROUGH A REAL DIVERGENCE (2.18ec). The circuit
 * moved to keccak while the library stayed on chained Poseidon v1, and this file kept passing,
 * because a pinned number only asks whether SOLIDITY changed. The question is whether the two SIDES
 * agree.
 *
 * SO THE ANCHOR IS A REAL PROOF. `recursion_tree_n16.json` carries the sixteen withdrawals' signals
 * AND the root its genuine proof exposes on-chain. Recomputing the tree from those signals and
 * requiring the real root back is the strongest form of this check available: it compares the
 * contract against what the CIRCUITS ACTUALLY PRODUCED, not against a number typed in beside them.
 * Regenerate with `python3 build-recursion-tree.py 16`.
