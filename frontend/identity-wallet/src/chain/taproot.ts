// BIP-341 hashing for the swap-in deposit address — the part of the QR verifier that decides
// whether the hop is bound to the terms it showed you.
//
// 🔑 **THE ADDRESS IS THE OUTPUT, NEVER AN INPUT.** A verifier that recomputes a hop-supplied
// address from hop-supplied values proves only that the hop is self-consistent, which was never
// in doubt. Everything here is fed from what the WALLET owns (`userRefund`, `seller`) or what the
// USER WAS SHOWN AND ACCEPTED (`token`, `minDeliveredUsd`, `cltvHeight`) — and the quoted address
// is compared against the result, never mixed into it.
//
// ⚠️ **THIS FILE IS THE HASH LAYER ONLY, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.** Turning a leaf hash into a
// `bc1p…` address additionally needs (a) the BIP-341 TapTweak, which is an EC point add over
// secp256k1, and (b) bech32m. Neither is here, because neither should be hand-rolled —
// `@scure/btc-signer` (same maintainer as the `@noble/*` packages already in this wallet) is the
// intended source and is not yet a dependency. **Landing the hashing separately is what lets it
// be pinned against the Solidity and Rust suites today** rather than waiting on that decision.
//
// 🔑 **A LEAF HASH, NOT A MERKLE ROOT — the tree is ONE leaf.** The terms are committed by a
// dropped push inside the refund leaf (`depositLeafScript`), so there is no branch to compute and
// no `tapBranch` here. An earlier version had one; it survived the redesign as dead code for a
// day, which standing rule 1 forbids — if a second leaf is ever wanted, BIP-341's TapBranch is
// five lines and should be added deliberately rather than found lying around.
//
// ✅ `refundLeafScript` IS now here, TRANSCRIBED from `ExitLib._cltvRefundLeaf` rather than
// re-derived — including `_scriptNum`, whose minimal little-endian encoding with a sign pad is
// exactly where a re-derivation goes wrong. Its own comment is the warning: *"a wrong encoding
// changes the leaf hash and therefore the ADDRESS, silently deriving somewhere no deposit will
// ever land."*
// ⚠️ **STILL OWED: a fixture shared with the Solidity and Rust builders.** The tests below pin
// the opcode sequence and every `scriptNum` edge case from Bitcoin's rule, which is where
// transcription errors live — but three implementations agreeing is only demonstrated for
// `tapBranch` so far. Do the same for a full leaf before trusting an address end to end.
