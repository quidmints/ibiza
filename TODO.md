# TODO — canonical tracker

Ordered by **implementation sequence**, not discovery order. Superseded material and the history of
how conclusions were reached have been removed; what remains is either actionable, a decision
someone has to make, or a fact that will cost you time if you don't know it.

Update in place. If you kill an item, say why in one line — the reason is what stops it being
re-proposed.

## 1. Build & toolchain

**Exactly one toolchain combination works. This is enforced, not advisory.**

| | version |
|---|---|
| nargo | `1.0.0-beta.26+quid-icefix1` — a **locally patched** build, see §1a |
| bb | `6.0.0-nightly.20260804`, pinned in `backend/circuits/package.json`. An **npm package, not bbup**: `npm install` there, then put `node_modules/.bin` on PATH. 5.1.0 is no longer referenced by anything (2.18eh). |

**⚠️ beta.13 + bb 1.2.0 ARE DEAD (corrected 2026-08-02, user: "forget bb 1.2.0 and beta.13, it's
old").** This table went on naming them long after the beta.26 migration landed, and
`codegen-verifiers.sh`'s own header said the same thing — while the guard fifty lines below it
enforced beta.26 / 5.1.0. That header carries a warning about this exact drift having happened once
before; it then happened again, to the version that fixed it. **Read `REQUIRED_NARGO` /
`REQUIRED_BB` in the script — the constants are what runs, the prose is what rots.** Verified
2026-08-02 by running both binaries: `nargo --version` → `1.0.0-beta.26+quid-icefix1`,
`bb --version` → `5.1.0`, matching the guard exactly.

`backend/circuits/codegen-verifiers.sh` refuses to run on anything else, and **validates its own
output** before writing artifacts (native `bb verify` + a two-run determinism check). Do not weaken
either guard — §7 explains what they catch.

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.bb:$PATH"                                  # or codegen reports bb missing
cd backend/contracts && forge build && forge test              # 430 ✅
cd backend/circuits/pp && nargo test                           # 87/87 ✅
cd backend/circuits/noir_dl_lib && nargo test                  # 77/77 ✅
./backend/circuits/codegen-verifiers.sh                        # step 4 of 5 — then step 5:
./tools/prove-escrow-fixtures.sh                               # skipping it ⇒ SumcheckFailed()
python3 tools/check-client-abis.py                             # TS ABI ↔ Solidity cross-check
cd frontend/identity-wallet && npx tsc --noEmit --strict       # ✅
cd backend/cre/sanctions_lists && GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build ./...   # ✅
cd backend/cre/sanctions_lists && go test ./...                # host-side; the logic carries no build tag
```

**ONE toolchain for everything — no split.** All 13 circuit crates compile on beta.26 with no ICE;
the six that could not (`register_identity{,_td1,_light_td1}`, `query_identity{,_td1}`,
`escrow_envelope`) were blocked by `noir_dl_lib`, now migrated. Counts: noir_dl_lib 77/77, pp 87/87,
escrow_envelope 4/4, withdraw_identity 5/5, notary_action 5/5, ragequit 3/3.

**`bb` REQUIRES `-k <vk>` on `prove`; 0.82.2 did not.** Omitting it does not error — bb exits 0
and writes a proof against a different key that its own verifier rejects with `SumcheckFailed()`.
This single flag masqueraded as a bb-version incompatibility for a long time. It is now passed
explicitly in `codegen-verifiers.sh`, and the self-checks would catch a regression anyway.

**ZK is the DEFAULT** (opt out with `--disable_zk`). On 0.82.2 it was opt-in via `--zk`,
and omitting it silently produced witness-leaking proofs — upstream inverted the flag because the
old default was a footgun.

**⚠ EIP-170 headroom is thin** — the withdrawal verifiers sit within ~85 bytes of the 24,576 limit,
already with `optimizer_runs = 1` scoped to those two files, and every bb major so far has emitted a
larger verifier than the last. **Check `forge build --sizes` after every regeneration** — a circuit
change could push these over, and the failure would only appear at deploy time.

**Why a patched compiler?** The ICE (`ice: all function ids should have metadata`) is **still
unfixed upstream at beta.26**, which is the newest release; `backend/circuits/noir-ice-repro/` is a
14-line dependency-free reproduction. Our compiler carries the fix, and our SOURCE also carries the
`BigNumParams` accommodation (22 `global` → `pub fn`, measured at zero gate cost) so the circuits
build on **stock** beta.26 too — which is the only reason CI or another machine can build them at
all. Revert the accommodation when upstream ships the fix (task 26).

### 1b. Wallet launch readiness — BLOCKED ON HARDWARE, and it is an ARCHITECTURE block (2026-07-27)

**The wallet cannot be run on this machine, and no simulator will validate the enclave design.**
Two independent blockers; buying a phone clears the second, not the first.

**Blocker 1 — the native proving binaries are arm64-only.** This is not "install the SDKs":

| binary | slices present | consequence |
|---|---|---|
| `@rarimo/rarime-rn-sdk/android/libs/noir.aar` | `jni/arm64-v8a` **only** | no `x86_64` ⇒ **proving cannot run on an x86 Android emulator at all** |
| `ios/Frameworks/SwoirenbergLib.xcframework` | `ios-arm64`, `ios-arm64-simulator`, `macos-arm64` | simulator slice is **arm64** ⇒ needs an Apple Silicon host |

This dev machine is an **Intel Mac (x86_64, macOS 15.7.4)**, whose iOS Simulator is x86_64. There is
no slice for it. **A wallet build requires an Apple Silicon Mac** (or an arm64 Android emulator,
which is itself Apple-Silicon-hosted). Toolchains are also absent: `/usr/bin/xcodebuild` is the
CommandLineTools stub (`xcrun simctl` unavailable, so there is no iOS Simulator at all), no `adb`,
no `emulator`, and Java is 1.8 where modern AGP needs 17+.

**Blocker 2 — a simulator exercises the code path but NOT the security property.** `identity/root.ts`
is deliberately fail-closed: `InsecureDeviceError` when `SecureStore.canUseBiometricAuthentication()`
returns false — *"refusing to store the root seed"* — alongside `requireAuthentication: true` and
`keychainAccessible: WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`. Its own comment: proceeding *"would store
identity + all PP notes without the hardware backing this design requires."*

The iOS Simulator **can** enrol Face ID (Features → Face ID → Enrolled), so the gate passes — but
**the Secure Enclave is emulated in software**. Android emulators are the same: the keystore works,
but software-backed, and StrongBox is unavailable. So a simulator can confirm that identity + PP
notes derive from one seed and that the biometric session-cache UX behaves — it can **never** confirm
anything is hardware-protected.

**⇒ The "notes + identity in one enclave" design is verifiable ONLY on physical hardware.** The
target device (Samsung A16, Knox, arm64) matches the AAR's only slice, so it will work — untested.

**What this blocks: device-only work.** NFC scanning (§2.6), on-device proving time, the Knox-backed
enclave path, real biometric prompts. **What it does NOT block:** everything in §1c.

**Not available on this machine:** JDK/Android SDK/NDK, Xcode. No device build has ever been
attempted, so anything Android-specific is unverified.

### 1c. What to do while hardware-blocked

**The critical path is NOT device-blocked. §2.1 is still the right next task** — witness assembly is
pure TypeScript over primitives that already exist, and it is validated by a **Forge test against a
real proof**, not by running the wallet. Same for §2.5 (circuit work) and the §3 items below. Device
hardware gates *validation of the mobile client*, not construction of the protocol.

Ranked by value while waiting on the phone:

1. **§2.1 witness assembly** — the actual blocker on anyone withdrawing at all. Fully unblocked.
2. **§2.4c share-denominated notes** — the design work for "depositors keep their own yield" is
   contract + circuit shaped, no device involved.
3. **§2.5 predicate-bound revocation** — circuit work.
4. **§3 items that are pure TS/Solidity** — denomination splitting, ERC-5564 stealth withdrawals,
   the stables leg of `SpvTreasuryAdapter`, the orphaned `bitcoin.nr`, `App.tsx` zero addresses.
5. **Prepare the device work so the phone is not itself a blocker later** — write the NFC (§2.6)
   integration against `@rarimo/rarime-rn-sdk`'s documented surface, and stage a CI job for the
   never-run ECDSA/recursion Noir suites (§3).

**Do NOT** start §2.4 (aggregator — explicitly deferred) or §2.7 (iran repo — last).

**`bb` needs AVX2/BMI2.** It SIGILLs on CPUs without them (an i3-U330 was the original blocker; an
i9-9880H is fine). Check before assuming a machine can't run it. `bb.js` (WASM) is the fallback.

---

## 2. Critical path — in this order

> **READ THIS BEFORE COUNTING: SECTION 2 IS A DECISION LOG, NOT A BACKLOG.**
>
> It is ~480,000 of this file's ~500,000 characters and holds 146 numbered sections - and **the

### 2.1 Wallet-side withdrawal witness assembly — ✅ DONE 2026-07-27

**Was the blocker on anyone withdrawing at all.** Everything downstream (gas work, aggregation)
optimises a path that now works end-to-end in everything except on-device proving (§1b).

**NEXT: §2.5 (revocation, circuit work) or §3 items — NOT §2.4.** The aggregator remains explicitly
deferred by the user, and §2.6/§2.7 need hardware.

Exists: `pp/discovery.ts` (finds your notes), `pp/notes.ts` (secret derivations), `pp/relay.ts`
(withdrawal + `context`), `postman/identityAsp.ts` (`IdentityAspTree.proof()` for ASP siblings,
`loadIdentityAspTree` to rebuild from chain).

**STATUS 2026-07-27: both pieces are BUILT and VALIDATED AGAINST THE REAL CIRCUIT.**

1. ✅ **State-tree mirror** — `src/pp/stateTree.ts`. `StateTree` + `loadStateTree()`.
2. ✅ **The assembler** — `src/pp/withdrawWitness.ts`. `buildWithdrawalWitness()` →
   **19 inputs** (8 public + 11 private; the old "20-field" count was wrong) + `pubSignals` in
   ProofLib order. `nextWithdrawalIndex()` derives the change-note index rather than trusting a
   caller-supplied integer, which is the one input that can silently make the remainder unspendable.

**Validated by running the actual circuit, not by typechecking.** A witness assembled by these
modules was fed to `nargo execute` on `withdraw_identity`: *"Circuit witness successfully solved."*
Two negative controls confirm the test is not vacuous — tampering `state_siblings[0]` fails at
`main.nr:68` (the `computed_state_root == state_root` assert) and tampering `sk_identity` fails at
`identity_asp.nr:61` (ASP membership), with the untampered witness re-solving afterwards.

Three findings the build produced, each recorded where it bites:

- **`State.sol:152` emitted `size` into a field named `_index`** — i.e. `index + 1` — while
  `Entrypoint._admitIdentity` emits the true `size - 1`. Fixed to `size - 1`. It had **zero
  consumers** at the time, so this was free; the state mirror would have been the first. Left
  unfixed it is an off-by-one that yields a proof rejected on-chain with nothing pointing back.
- **`State._insert` does NOT reject duplicate leaves** (unlike `Entrypoint`, which enforces
  `aspAdmitted`). So `LeanIMT.indexOf` — first match wins — is unsafe here. `StateTree` takes proofs
  **by index** and `leafIndexOf` throws on ambiguity instead of guessing.
- **`LeafInserted` is the leaf feed, not `Deposited`/`Withdrawn`.** Both insert sites
  (`PrivacyPool.sol:140` deposit, `:162` change note) funnel through `State._insert`, which emits one
  `LeafInserted` per leaf in tree order. Replaying the two user-facing events instead would mean
  re-deriving that interleaving from log order — reconstructible, but strictly worse.

✅ **The end-to-end Forge test now exists and passes.** `test/pool/WithdrawalHonkVerifier.t.sol`
gained `test_VerifiesWalletAssembledWitness`: the wallet's modules assembled a witness, `nargo
execute` solved it, `bb 1.2.0` proved it (`bb verify` OK natively), and the **on-chain
`WithdrawalHonkVerifier` accepts it** — fixture `test/fixtures/withdraw_identity_wallet.proof`,
regenerated by `tools/build-withdrawal-fixture.js` (deterministic, `sk_identity` pinned to 1234).
**162/162 Forge**, up from 157.

**It is strictly stronger than the baseline fixture, which is degenerate.** The baseline uses
size-1 trees: one leaf, all-zero siblings, so the LeanIMT carry-up rule makes the root equal the
leaf, depth is 0 and **no sibling is ever hashed**. The wallet witness has state depth 3 / ASP depth
2 over trees with filler leaves, so real multi-level sibling hashing is on the proven path.
`test_WalletWitnessExercisesRealMerklePaths` asserts both depths stay > 0 so a future regeneration
cannot silently fall back to the degenerate case. A cross-fixture guard
(`test_BaselineProofDoesNotVerifyWalletSignals`) pins that one proof cannot be presented with the
other's public signals.

**Note for anyone regenerating: on bb 1.2.0 there is NOTHING TO STRIP.** `bb prove` writes
`target/proof` and `target/public_inputs` as separate files and `target/proof` IS the fixture format
(16,224 bytes). The "strip the 4-byte field count and the 8 leading public-input fields" line in the
baseline fixture's provenance comment is a 0.82.2-era instruction from when the two were
concatenated.

### 2.1a Wallet proving bridge — ✅ PORTED 2026-07-27. Two real constraints remain.

Found while wiring §2.1's endpoint: the wallet could not produce a Honk proof at all, because
`src/sdk/` is a vendored copy of `@rarimo/rarime-rn-sdk` that declared **only `provePlonk`**, and it
is the copy the wallet actually imports (`Rarime.ts`, `Freedomtool.ts`, `Eudi.ts` all import
`"./RnNoirModule"`, never the package).

✅ **`proveHonk` ported into the local copy** (`src/sdk/RnNoirModule.ts` + `src/sdk/src/NoirModule.ts`).
✅ **`withdraw_identity` (8 public signals) and `title_holder` (2) registered** in
`supportedNoirCircuits`.

✅ **DE-DUPLICATED 2026-07-27 — `src/sdk/` went from 32 files to 6.** All fixes were upstreamed to
`quidmints/rarime-rn-sdk` first, then the copies deleted and imports repointed at the package.

**Why the copy existed at all: the package was IMPORTABLE BY NOBODY.** Not a style choice — a chain
of packaging defects, each hiding the next:
1. `npm install` of the SDK failed outright with **ERESOLVE** (`typescript@7` vs `@li0ard/tsemrtd`'s
   peer `^5`), so its devDependencies never installed;
2. so `prepare` could not build — and `prepare` was `expo-module prepare`, **a documented no-op**
   that never built anything regardless;
3. so `build/` was never produced, while `main`/`types` pointed *into* it;
4. and a real build would have failed anyway on **26 TypeScript errors** (17 mechanical
   `verbatimModuleSyntax`, **9 genuine unchecked-index defects** on parsed passport/contract data).

All fixed upstream. The package now installs, builds, and resolves. **Seven SDK defects total** —
also: the expo-file-system 57 migration (it used the API 57 removed while pinning `~57.0.1`),
`@noble/hashes` v2 subpaths, `1 << v` int32 vote truncation, undeclared `buffer`, and a hardcoded
Android AAR path. Plus `registerNoirCircuit()` / `bundledAsset` and a broadened root export surface,
without which a consumer with its own circuits still had no option but to fork the module.

**The 6 remaining files are ones the package genuinely lacks:** `Rarime.ts` (a real superset —
`holderRegistrationAddress`, `generateRegistrationMaterial()`), `HolderTree.ts`,
`holder/HolderContracts.ts`, `Eudi.ts`, `circuits.ts` (registers our two circuits — ~40 lines
replacing a ~250-line vendored `RnNoirModule.ts`), and `index.ts`.

**Also fixed: `metro.config.js` mapped `@rarimo/rarime-rn-sdk` → `path.resolve(__dirname, '..')`**,
i.e. `frontend/` — a directory holding only `identity-wallet/` and `secure-recovery/`, not the SDK.
A leftover from an autolinked-sibling layout. Removed; the package resolves from `node_modules`.

✅ **Circuit bytecode is now BUNDLED INTO THE APP** — was "built but hosted nowhere", so
`downloadByteCode` had nothing to fetch. `assets/circuits/{withdraw_identity,title_holder}.circuit`
(3.27 MB + 0.35 MB) ship in the bundle; `metro.config.js` registers `circuit` in `assetExts` so
Metro treats them as opaque assets instead of inlining a 3.3 MB parsed object into the JS bundle;
`NoirCircuitParams.loadByteCode()` prefers the bundled asset and never touches the network.
**`codegen-verifiers.sh` re-copies them on every run**, so bundled bytecode cannot drift from the
circuit whose verifier was just generated — a drift that would produce proofs the on-chain verifier
rejects with nothing pointing at the stale asset.

Bundling is also the better security posture, not just a workaround: the bytecode determines what is
being proven, so fetching it from a mutable remote URL would put whoever controls that URL inside the
trust boundary of every proof.

---

**TWO OPEN ITEMS — both device-gated, neither a code defect. Do not close without hardware (§1b).**

**(a) iOS has no Honk path — UltraHonk proving is Android-only.**
`ios/RnNoirModule.swift` exposes only `provePlonk` and hardcodes `proof_type: "plonk"`. Android
implements it (`android/.../RnNoirModule.kt:69`, `proofType = "honk"`). So every Honk circuit in this
fusion (`withdraw_identity`, `title_holder`) is Android-only until **Swoirenberg's Honk entry point
is exposed on the Swift side**. **Fine for the A16** — and it aligns with §1b rather than fighting
it: the target Samsung A16 is Android/arm64, which is both the only platform with a Honk path AND the
only ABI slice `noir.aar` ships. **An iOS launch is blocked on this and cannot be worked around
client-side.**

**(b) `proveHonk` reuses `ultraPlonkTrustedSetup.dat` — reasoning, not measurement.**
Barretenberg's SRS is a universal curve-level KZG setup shared across its proof systems rather than
Plonk-specific, so it **should** be correct for Honk despite the filename. But that is an argument,
not a measurement, and there is no device to measure on (§1b). **This is the FIRST thing to check if
device proving fails**; the fix, if it is wrong, is a Honk-specific SRS download. Recorded at the
constant itself (`NoirCircuitParams.TrustedSetupFile`) so whoever hits the failure finds it.

### 2.2 Gas: where it actually stands — UltraPlonk is REJECTED, aggregation is the answer

**DECIDED (user, 2026-07-27): no UltraPlonk. We stay on UltraHonk.** Deprecated from bb 0.87.0 with
no patched version to migrate to if a soundness bug appears — unacceptable for a value-bearing pool.
This also removes the constraint that used to gate the toolchain bump, so §2.3 can proceed freely.

**The gas problem is NOT solved, and recent work made it worse — deliberately.** Do not mistake the
volume of Honk work for progress on cost:

| | gas | note |
|---|---|---|
| before the `--zk` fix | 1,770,591 | proofs were **not zero-knowledge** — leaked the witness |
| after | 2,760,141 | **+51%**, the cost of blinding |
| + calldata (15,712 B × 16) | **3,011,533** | ≈ **$271** @30 gwei, ETH $3k |

The `--zk` fix was **correctness, not optimisation** — we were shipping proofs that leaked
`sk_identity`, `label`, `nullifier` and `secret`. The EIP-170 work (24,534 → 23,527 bytes) was a
*deployment* fix, not a gas one. Everything else was measurement.

**Consequence for L1:** at ~$271 a withdrawal, the pool is only usable for withdrawals around $5k
and up (for the fee to stay under 5%). That is a product constraint, not a line item.

**The only remaining answer is aggregation** (§2.4): ~68k/withdrawal at N=16, ~41k at N=64. It is
blocked solely on §2.3. Optimising UltraHonk itself cannot help — the irreducible precompile floor
is ~568k, and a Yul rewrite plus a forked bb would still land ~1.5M. There is no third option that
preserves what the protocol guarantees.

### 2.3 Dependency tree — ✅ DONE 2026-07-27. All circuits on beta.13 + bb 1.2.0, no split.

**527 compile errors → 0, by deleting dead code rather than migrating a library.**

The blocker was never our circuits. `pp` / `withdraw_identity` / `title_holder` used exactly ONE
function out of rarime's ~16k-line `noir_dl_lib` — `extract_pk_identity_hash`, **9 lines** — which
needs exactly ONE helper, `jubjub::priv_to_pub`, **126 lines with zero imports**. Importing those
135 lines dragged in the entire passport-verification stack (`sigver`, `big_curve`, `bignum`, every
ECDSA curve), making the PP circuits hostage to migrating a library they never use.

**What was done:**
1. **Deleted `noir_dl_lib/src/bitcoin.nr` and `recursion.nr`** — both orphaned (`lib.nr` never
   declared either; nothing referenced them). `bitcoin.nr` was the *only* consumer of the
   `ripemd160` dependency, so dropping it removed **548 of the errors on its own**. `recursion.nr`
   was dead UltraPlonk-era code (`[Field; 114]` VK shapes).
2. **Copied the 135 needed lines into `pp`** as `pp/src/jubjub.nr` + `pp/src/holder_root.nr`,
   verbatim, with headers explaining why they are copies and must not be "cleaned up".
3. **Dropped the `noir_dl` dependency from `pp` entirely.** The PP circuits no longer depend on the
   passport library at all.
4. **Bumped `poseidon` v0.1.0 → v0.2.0** and imported `PoseidonHasher` from the library rather than
   `std` (beta.13 removed it from std), plus an explicit `use std::hash::Hasher;`.

**Result — verified both ways:**

| | nargo beta.1 | nargo beta.13 |
|---|---|---|
| `pp` / `withdraw_identity` / `title_holder` | **COMPILES** | **COMPILES** |
| `pp` tests | **53/53** | **53/53** |

**The derivation is byte-identical, and that is what the tests prove.** `priv_to_pub` defines
`holder_root` — the durable identity commitment `HolderStateKeeper` anchors and the wallet computes
as `profileKey`. The published vectors in `identity_asp.nr` / `title_holder.nr`
(`sk_identity = 1234 → holder_root`) pass on **both** toolchains and against **both** poseidon
versions, so identity has not forked across circuit / contract / wallet.

**Why this matters:** beta.13 is bb 1.2.0's matched pair, and bb 1.x is where ZK-under-recursion
works. **The aggregation path (§2.4) is no longer blocked by our source.**

**PASSPORT CIRCUITS — MIGRATION COMPLETE 2026-07-27. 542 → 0 errors on beta.13.**

Every circuit compiles on beta.13: `pp`, `withdraw_identity`, `title_holder`, `query_identity`,
`query_identity_td1`, `register_identity_light_td1`, and `register_identity` (the ~16k-line one).
**Tests: 53/53 `pp`, 49/49 `noir_dl_lib`.**

**Every remaining fix was reviewed individually, not scripted, because they were integer-width
changes in bignum LIMB ARITHMETIC where a wrong cast compiles cleanly and truncates silently:**
- `u60_representation` shift operands — all bounded by `% 60` (0..59), so widening to `u64` is a
  type fix, never a truncation.
- `msb.nr` de Bruijn index — `u64 >> 57` yields 0..127 against a `[u32; 128]` table. Exact fit.
- `sha1`/`sha384` rotation amounts — bounded 0..31 / 0..63 by construction.
- `carry as bool` / `borrow as bool` — both produced by `(<comparison>) as u64`, so strictly 0 or 1;
  `!= 0` is exactly equivalent.
- `sha224` byte shifts — `shifts <= 3`.
- `big_curve` lookup indices came from an UNCONSTRAINED search hint, so rather than assume the
  bound, `assert_max_bit_size::<32>()` was ADDED before narrowing. Safe by constraint, not by
  construction.
- `u8`→`u32` index casts are widening and cannot truncate.

**New code written (the only non-mechanical part):** `noir_dl_lib/src/sha512.nr`. The stdlib dropped
`std::sha512` after beta.1 and there is **no `noir-lang/sha512` package**. This library already
contained the complete SHA-512 core inside `sha384.nr` (SHA-384 *is* SHA-512 with a different IV,
truncated to 48 bytes, FIPS 180-4), so sha512 reuses those exact helpers — only the IV and the
absence of truncation differ. **Verified against Python `hashlib.sha512` for both the one-block and
multi-block padding paths.** `sha256` came from `noir-lang/sha256` v0.2.0.

**More dead code removed:** `sigver/recursive_curve_proofs.nr` — exported but referenced nowhere,
and its failing call was a `#[test]` with hardcoded UltraPlonk-era verification keys that can never
validate on Honk. Same category as `bitcoin.nr` / `recursion.nr`.

**Interface change:** `register_identity/src/main.nr` no longer takes `dg15: [u8; 0]` — beta.13
rejects zero-length entry-point types. The DG15 length generic was already `0`, so the parameter
carried no data; it is constructed locally. **Constraints and public inputs are unchanged.**

**There is NO toolchain split — see §1.** Passport circuits are forward-only onto beta.13 (they no
longer build on beta.1), PP circuits build on both, and verifier generation runs on beta.13 + bb
1.2.0 like everything else. An earlier revision of this section claimed "verifier generation still
requires beta.1 + bb 0.82.2, because bb 1.x remains unusable" and that `codegen-verifiers.sh` stays
pinned to beta.1 — **both were true only until the flag below was found, and both are now false.**

**bb 1.x WORKS — the blocker was a missing flag, not an incompatibility (resolved 2026-07-27).**

**Root cause: `bb 1.x`'s `prove` REQUIRES `-k <vk>`. `bb 0.82.2`'s did not.** Without it, bb 1.2.0
silently proves against a different key, producing a proof its own verifier rejects with
`SumcheckFailed()`. It does NOT error, warn, or hint — it exits 0 and writes a plausible-looking
proof. Every "bb 1.x is broken / silently produces invalid proofs" conclusion recorded earlier in
this project was this flag, and was wrong.

**Verified working on nargo beta.13 + bb 1.2.0:**
- native `bb verify` — **passes**
- on-chain via the generated Solidity verifier — **passes, 2,747,575 gas**
- `publicInputsSize: 18` for `title_holder` = 2 real + 16 pairing-point accumulator, exactly as the
  generated verifier expects (2 from calldata, 16 read from the proof)
- **ZK under `--honk_recursion 1`: two runs of one witness give DIFFERENT proofs, and the recursion
  proof verifies natively.** This is the property aggregation needs, and it now holds end to end.

**HOW IT WAS FOUND — the technique is the reusable part.** Every attempt against the real circuit
failed identically, which made it look like a version incompatibility. Building a MINIMAL circuit
(`fn main(x: pub Field, y: Field) { assert(x == y * 2); }`) and running the same pipeline surfaced
the real error immediately: `Unable to open file: ./target/vk`. On the big circuit that message was
lost in the noise; on a two-line circuit it was the only output. **When a toolchain fails
identically on everything, reproduce it on the smallest possible input before concluding the
toolchain is at fault.**

**CONSEQUENCE: aggregation (§2.4) is UNBLOCKED.** The toolchain requirement is nargo beta.13 +
bb 1.2.0, both of which now build every circuit in this repo.

✅ **The repo pin was moved — all three follow-ups are DONE** (kept here only because each records a
0.82.2-vs-1.x behavioural difference that will bite anyone reading older material):
1. `codegen-verifiers.sh` is pinned to beta.13 / 1.2.0, passes `-k target/vk` on `prove` (the whole
   bug), and no longer passes `--zk` — **bb 1.x is ZK BY DEFAULT**; the opt-out is `--disable_zk`.
2. **1.x has NO 4-byte length prefix and writes public inputs to a SEPARATE file**, so there is
   nothing to strip out of `target/proof` — it is directly the fixture format. Any instruction to
   "strip the 4-byte field count and the 8 leading public-input fields" is 0.82.2-era. The proof
   carries 16 accumulator fields (491 + 16 = 507).
3. Both verifiers regenerated; Forge is green at **162 tests**.

**Also newly reachable: bb 5.x.** It was rejected only because it needs msgpack ACIR from a newer
nargo, and newer nargo previously ICE'd on our pre-migration code. Post-migration, beta.22 is down
to ~10-13 errors (library-version drift: poseidon v0.2.0's `RATE` global, `u1` → `bool`) plus one
remaining ICE in `query_identity`. Not needed for aggregation — beta.13 + bb 1.2.0 suffices — but no
longer a dead end either.

**Previous partial work (superseded, safe to delete):** `/tmp/noir_dl_lib.migrated`.**

`register_identity` / `query_identity` still carry the full `noir_dl_lib`. Migrating it: **542 → 73
errors**, all mechanical, in this order (each number is what it cleared):

| fix | cleared |
|---|---|
| `use crate::bignum::BigNumTrait;` where `.__add`/`.__neg`/`.__mul`/`__invmod` are called (7 files) | 135 |
| `mod X;` → `pub mod X;` in `sigver/mod.nr` etc; `pub` on `params` / `CurveParamsTrait` | 113 |
| wrap `let x = <expr with .__>;` bodies in `unsafe { }` (69 sites) | 100 |
| `PoseidonHasher` + `Poseidon2` moved out of std → `poseidon` lib (add the dep) | 46 |
| `sha256` left std → `noir-lang/sha256`, and `sha256_var` takes `(msg, len)` | 23 |
| `ScalarFieldTrait` / `RuntimeBigNumTrait` / `std::ops::{Mul,Add,Sub,Div,Neg}` imports | 52 |

**The remaining 73 are integer-width tightenings inside bignum LIMB ARITHMETIC** — `u64`→`u32`
indexing, mismatched bit widths, `u64 as bool`. **Do not script these.** A wrong cast silently
truncates in cryptographic code, and unlike every other class here it would compile cleanly. Each
site needs reading in context.

**HISTORICAL — this describes a mid-migration state that no longer exists.** The migration makes
`noir_dl_lib` beta.13-forward and therefore beta.1-incompatible, so mid-migration it built on
NEITHER, and was reverted via git at the time. **That revert has since been superseded: the
migration was completed and the pin MOVED to beta.13 + bb 1.2.0 (§1).** Nothing compiles on beta.1
any more, and nothing needs to. Kept only because the integer-width guidance above is still the
right way to review that class of change.

✅ **ALL OF THIS IS DONE — the pin HAS moved (§1). Retained only as a record of what it took.**
- The **passport** circuits (`register_identity`, `query_identity`) carried the full `noir_dl_lib`
  and ~527 errors on beta.13 (110 `unsafe {}` blocks, ~130 trait-import lines, 42 type-inference,
  plus `PoseidonHasher`/`sha256` path moves). **Migrated: 542 → 0.**
- bb 1.2.0's verifier expects a **pairing-point accumulator**. Confirmed present and handled: the
  proof carries 16 accumulator fields and the generated Solidity reads them from the proof itself
  (`publicInputsSize - PAIRING_POINTS_SIZE` comes from calldata).
- `ProofLib` and `codegen-verifiers.sh` were updated for the 1.x proof format — no 4-byte length
  prefix, and public inputs written to a SEPARATE file rather than prepended.

### 2.4pre Feasibility spike — MEASURED 2026-07-27. It fits, but barely, and there are traps.

**Run before committing to a design, because "it does not fit" would have changed N and the tree
shape.** A throwaway N-proof aggregator was built, its Solidity verifier generated and compiled;
the spike was then deleted. Findings:

**1. It FITS — but ONLY with `optimizer_runs = 1`, and with 83 bytes to spare.**

| build | runtime bytecode | vs EIP-170 (24,576) |
|---|---|---|
| default optimizer | **25,506** | **930 OVER — would not deploy** |
| `optimizer_runs = 1` | **24,493** | fits, **83 bytes** margin |

The aggregation verifier will need its own `compilation_restrictions` entry in `foundry.toml`, like
the two existing verifiers. **Margin is effectively zero** — the same knife-edge as the withdrawal
verifier's 85 bytes.

**2. Verifier size is INDEPENDENT OF N.** N=1, 4 and 16 all produce a ~90,372-byte source and the
same bytecode (±2 bytes). Honk's verifier is a fixed algorithm; N grows the *circuit*, not the
contract. **So N=16 costs nothing on-chain versus N=1** — the sizing decision is about proving time
and batch latency (§2.4b), not EIP-170.

**3. That result DEPENDS on keeping the public surface at ONE field.** The spike exposes a single
`batch_commitment` (a Poseidon fold over every inner proof's 8 public signals) rather than N×8
public inputs. The verifier's calldata handling scales with public inputs, and 83 bytes leaves no
room for that. **A design that surfaces per-withdrawal signals will not fit.** Nothing is lost by
compressing — the pool still checks each withdrawal's real signals itself.

**4. TRAP — `bb` SIGSEGVs (exit 139) on a wrong in-circuit vk length; it does NOT error.** It
segfaults *after* printing "Scheme is: ultra_honk", so anything grepping stdout for errors reads it
as success. Same family as the `-k`-on-`prove` footgun (§1).

**⚠️ CORRECTED 2026-08-01 — the lengths recorded here were WRONG, which is dangerous in exactly this
trap.** This section said the in-circuit key is **128 fields** and the on-disk `target/vk` is 55.
Measured on bb 1.2.0 with `--output_format fields`:

| artifact | fields |
|---|---|
| `write_vk --oracle_hash keccak` (the on-chain key) | **111** |
| `write_vk --honk_recursion 1` (the in-circuit key) | **112** |
| proof (`--honk_recursion 1`) | **507** ✅ as recorded |
| public inputs | **7** (see below) |

112 is **structural, not per-circuit** — `ragequit`'s recursion vk is also 112 — while the CONTENTS
differ per circuit, which is what makes pinning the contents meaningful. Use 112.

**5. The public-signal count is 7, not 8.** This section said the batch commitment folds "every
inner proof's 8 public signals". `ProofLib.WithdrawProof.pubSignals` is `uint256[7]`,
`publicInputsBytes32` allocates `new bytes32[](7)`, `codegen-verifiers.sh`'s own target list says
`withdraw_identity:...:7`, and `bb prove --output_format fields` emits 7. An off-by-one here is not
cosmetic: the fold must bind exactly the signals the CONTRACT recomputes over, so a commitment over
8 slots is one the contract can never reproduce.

**5. The recursion API on beta.13 is `std::verify_proof_with_type(vk, proof, public_inputs,
key_hash, proof_type)`.** `std::verify_proof` does NOT exist and `#[recursive]` is not in scope.
Poseidon is the external `noir-lang/poseidon` package, not `std::hash::poseidon`.

**Still unmeasured, needs the phone:** aggregation-circuit proving time, and per-user withdrawal
proving time on the A16 (§2.4b). Aggregation batches VERIFICATION — each user still proves their own
withdrawal locally, and that number is unchanged by any N.

### 2.4 Build the aggregator — DECIDED: build our own. **THE ORIGINAL REASON TO DEFER IS GONE.**

**Why it was deferred:** "comes after §2.1 — until wallet-side witness assembly exists no user can
withdraw at all, and aggregation optimises a path that does not yet work end to end." **§2.1 landed
2026-07-27**, the withdrawal works end to end against a real pool, and §2.4pre measured the verifier
at 24,491 bytes with 85 spare and confirmed ZK survives `--honk_recursion`. So the stated blocker no
longer holds and nothing technical is in the way.

**It remains deferred only by explicit instruction** (user, 2026-07-27: "we are building our own
aggregator but dont do this yet"). Worth re-confirming rather than treating as permanent — the
things that would sensibly precede it are §2.5b (ragequit, which is a correctness hole rather than
an optimisation) and on-device proving time, which needs the phone.

**Decision (user, 2026-07-27): we build our own aggregator.** Not an AVS (§2.4e — it secures the
wrong property), not Aligned (§2.4f — same work, plus a dependency on someone else's roadmap).
**N=16**, 16-wide tree if wider.

**STATUS CORRECTED 2026-07-31 — this section contradicted itself.** It opened by saying the stated
blocker "no longer holds and nothing technical is in the way", then five lines later repeated the
original instruction verbatim: *"But do NOT start it. §2.1 comes first: until wallet-side witness
assembly exists no user can withdraw at all."* A reader got opposite instructions from one section,
and the second was written when §2.1 was still open.

**BOTH STATED PRECONDITIONS ARE NOW MET, verified rather than assumed:**
- **§2.1 wallet-side witness assembly — DONE** (2026-07-27). `src/pp/` holds `withdrawWitness.ts`,
  `stateTree.ts`, `discovery.ts`, `notes.ts`, `identityProof.ts`, `deposit.ts`, `prove.ts`,
  `relay.ts`. Withdrawal works end to end against a real pool.
- **§2.5b ragequit — DONE** (2026-07-27). It was named as the thing that should sensibly precede
  aggregation, being a correctness hole rather than an optimisation. It is closed, ported to Noir,
  and has a real proof verified on-chain.
- **§2.3 toolchain — DONE.** ZK-under-recursion verified on beta.13 + bb 1.2.0.

**SO THE ONLY REMAINING GATE IS THE EXPLICIT INSTRUCTION** (user, 2026-07-27: *"we are building our
own aggregator but dont do this yet"*), and every reason given for it has since been satisfied. **The
aggregator does not exist** — there is no `backend/circuits/agg*` — so this is genuinely unstarted,
not partially built.

> **STALE - corrected 2026-08-04.** `backend/circuits/aggregate_withdrawals/` DOES exist, compiles, and
> its verifier is generated: `contracts/pool/verifiers/AggregationHonkVerifier.sol`, **circuitSize 2^24,
> 9 public inputs**. So it IS partially built. What is genuinely missing is narrower than "unstarted":
> **no `Prover.toml`, no end-to-end prove/verify on the CURRENT pin** (the recorded end-to-end run was
> beta.13 + bb 1.2.0; we are on beta.26 + bb 5.1.0), and **no forge test exercises it**. The path is:
> prove `withdraw_identity` (which HAS a committed Prover.toml) 16 times, feed those in, then write_vk
> and prove the aggregate under the 32 GiB swapfile.

It is the largest single remaining piece of work in the repo, and worth
re-confirming as a deliberate decision rather than inheriting a deferral whose stated grounds are
gone.

**WHAT IT IS WORTH, for that decision:** ~68k gas/withdrawal at N=16 versus the current
~200k+ single-proof verification — the difference between a pool that is usable for ordinary amounts
and one that is not. Nothing about it is blocked on a document, a phone, or the OPRF.

Design settled AND the toolchain now works: ZK-under-recursion verified end-to-end on
beta.13 + bb 1.2.0 (two runs of one witness give different proofs; the recursion proof verifies
natively). Nothing external blocks this any more.

**Who runs what.** Users prove their **own** withdrawal on-device (~1.3 s) — the witness never
leaves. A **batcher** runs the aggregation prover (~1M gates per inner proof, ~16M at N=16; tens of
GB, minutes) and sees only proofs and public inputs. **Anyone can be a batcher**: no registry, no
stake, no whitelist, paid through PP's existing relay fee. This is why recursion is required rather
than the cheaper "one circuit proving N withdrawals natively" — that needs one prover to hold
everyone's secrets.

**Four load-bearing constraints:**
1. **Inner verification key PINNED as a circuit constant, never an input** — otherwise a batcher
   aggregates proofs from a different circuit and forges withdrawals. Most important property here.
2. Every one of the N inner proofs actually verified — no short-circuit.
3. The batch commitment binds exactly those N public-input sets, **in order**.
4. The contract recomputes that commitment from calldata identically.
5. **The aggregator MUST replicate `PrivacyPool.validWithdrawal`'s range checks**, in particular
   `stateTreeDepth`/`ASPTreeDepth` `<= MAX_TREE_DEPTH`. The circuit casts those `Field` public
   inputs to `u32`, which TRUNCATES, and `lean_imt_inclusion` uses `actual_depth` **only** in its
   bound assert — it never affects the computed root. So a depth of `2^32 + 5` truncates to `5`
   in-circuit and passes. It is rejected today solely because the CONTRACT checks the full
   `uint256`. Any verifier that bypasses `PrivacyPool` loses that protection.

**Non-negotiables:** `PrivacyPool.withdraw` stays untouched, so self-submission at full gas always
works and a batcher refusing you costs money, never access. A batcher **cannot forge** — the
aggregate is verified on-chain, so worst case is refusal (liveness), never theft. That is the
structural difference from an AVS, where operators *attest* and you trust them.

**Oracle split — resolved.** Inner proofs use the default poseidon2 oracle + `--honk_recursion`; the
outer proof uses keccak. So a batching proof is not directly self-submittable. **The wallet retains
the witness until the withdrawal confirms and re-proves with keccak (~1.3 s) if it must
self-submit** — cheaper than generating two proofs every time. *Requirement: the wallet must not
discard the witness after handing a proof to a batcher.* An optimising refactor will delete that.

**Expected result**, using the measured model `verify_gas ≈ 2.38M + 3,510 × (public inputs)` —
circuit size is essentially free (44k-gate and 11.8k-gate circuits both ~2.7M):

| N per batch | gas/withdrawal (public inputs hash-compressed) |
|---|---|
| 1 | 2.39M |
| 16 | ~68k |
| 64 | ~41k |

**Costs to expect:** prover hardware is the ceiling (few batchers in practice, though entry stays
permissionless); low volume kills the economics (a batch of 3 costs ~800k each, not 41k); the
proof-relay layer is new infrastructure whose code must live in **ibiza**, not SPV (§7).

### 2.4a BUILD STARTED 2026-08-01 — circuit exists, compiles, unit-tested. **THE PROOF DOES NOT YET VERIFY.**

`backend/circuits/aggregate_withdrawals/` now exists (it did not before; sec. 2.4 said "there is no
`backend/circuits/agg*`"). What is DONE and what is NOT, stated separately because the difference
is the whole status:

**DONE and verified:**
- Circuit at **N=16**, compiles clean. `main` verifies all N proofs against a **pinned** inner key
  (`src/inner_vk.nr`, generated) and exposes ONE public input, the batch commitment.
- **11,610,552 gates measured** at N=16 (`bb gates`), against sec. 2.4b's 16M estimate.
- 5 Noir unit tests pass: the fold is order-binding (swapping two withdrawals changes the
  commitment), every one of the 7 signal positions is bound, and the depth range check rejects
  `MAX_TREE_DEPTH+1` **and** `2^32+5` (the truncation trap, constraint 5).
- N=2 witness solves, and the circuit's own fold reproduces the public input exactly
  (`0x0ede2720...af6eae`) — so the commitment construction and the witness are right.

**NOT DONE — `bb verify` REJECTS the outer proof: `Sumcheck failed!`**
Reproduced at N=2, both with and without `--init_kzg_accumulator` (that flag was the first
hypothesis; it is not the fix). ⚠️ **`bb verify` EXITS 0 ON FAILURE** — the printed text is the only
signal, the same shape as the `-k`-on-`prove` footgun. `bb check` cannot help: it answers
"API function check_witness not implemented" for ultra_honk.

**⚠️ THE SUSPECT WAS WRONG, AND THE FAULT IS NOT IN THE AGGREGATOR.** Isolated 2026-08-01 with a
MINIMAL recursion pair (`fn main(x: Field, y: pub Field) { assert(x * 2 == y); }` verified by a
9-line outer circuit). **The minimal case fails identically** - so nothing about the aggregator's
size, fold, pinned key or range checks is implicated. Iterating on it takes seconds, not minutes;
rebuild it before touching `aggregate_withdrawals` again.

**RULED OUT by experiment, do not re-try these:**
- `key_hash = 0` **and** `key_hash = Poseidon2(vk, 112)` (= `0x0673ba21...81156` for the minimal
  inner key). Both fail identically, so the fourth argument is not the cause.
- `--init_kzg_accumulator` on write_vk + prove. No effect; the outer proof still exposes ONE public
  input, never the 16-field pairing-point accumulator recursion is supposed to add.
- `--oracle_hash keccak` **and** the default poseidon2 transcript. Both fail, so this is not the
  documented "inner poseidon2 / outer keccak" split going wrong.
- `--honk_recursion 1` together with `--oracle_hash keccak` on the OUTER proof: bb writes **no vk at
  all** (exit 0, missing artifact - the failure mode `bb_checked` exists to catch). That combination
  appears to be rejected outright.

**THE DIAGNOSTIC FACT:** `nargo execute` SUCCEEDS every time, while the resulting proof always fails
sumcheck. Witness solving therefore does **not** validate the recursion constraints - it discharges
them as a black box and trusts the inputs. So "the witness solved" is worth nothing here as evidence,
and only `bb verify`'s TEXT is (it exits 0 on failure).

**AND RE-READ 2.4pre's EVIDENCE BEFORE TRUSTING IT.** That spike is described as having built an
N-proof aggregator, generated its Solidity verifier and compiled it - all of which measures verifier
BYTECODE SIZE, which needs no working proof. Nothing in that section claims `bb verify` ever accepted
a recursive proof. **There may be no evidence recursion has ever worked end-to-end in this repo**, and
the pinned toolchain (beta.13 + bb 1.2.0) supports standalone proving without that implying it
supports recursion.

**✅ SOLVED 2026-08-01 — THE BUG WAS `proof_type`, AND RECURSION WORKS ON THE PINNED TOOLCHAIN.**
`bb verify` now accepts an aggregation of two REAL `withdraw_identity` proofs on
nargo 1.0.0-beta.13 + bb 1.2.0. **No toolchain change is needed.**

**THE ROOT CAUSE: two unrelated enumerations that are trivially conflated.**
- bb's **CLI flag** `--honk_recursion` uses `1` = UltraHonk, `2` = UltraRollupHonk.
- The **in-circuit** `proof_type` argument of `std::verify_proof_with_type` uses Aztec's
  `PROOF_TYPE_*` set: **`PROOF_TYPE_HONK = 0`**, `PROOF_TYPE_ROLLUP_HONK = 4`,
  `PROOF_TYPE_HONK_ZK = 6` (`barretenberg/noir/bb_proof_verification/src/lib.nr`).

We passed `1` - which is in NEITHER position of the in-circuit set. **Use 0.**
(`6` is not usable on beta.13: the circuit fails to build.)

**WHY IT COST SO MUCH: every stage reports success.** The circuit COMPILES with a wrong
`proof_type`, `nargo execute` SOLVES the witness, and `bb prove` WRITES a proof. Only `bb verify`
objects, with `Sumcheck failed!` - which names sumcheck, not the parameter - and it **exits 0** while
saying so. Same family as the `-k`-on-`prove` and the `--zk`-silently-ignored footguns in sec. 1.

**⚠️ AN EARLIER REVISION OF THIS SECTION CONCLUDED "verify_proof_with_type IS BROKEN ON THIS
TOOLCHAIN" AND CALLED FOR A VERSION BUMP. THAT WAS WRONG** and is removed rather than left to
mislead. The reasoning looked strong - a control circuit consuming the same 112/507-field inputs
verified, the inner proof verified natively, and only adding the call broke it - and every one of
those observations was correct. They simply do not distinguish "the API is broken" from "we are
calling it with a bad argument". A control that isolates a CALL does not isolate its ARGUMENTS.

**THE PROOF-LENGTH CONSTANTS IN AZTEC'S `next` BRANCH DO NOT MATCH bb 1.2.0** - do not "fix" ours to
match them. That library declares `ULTRA_VK_LENGTH_IN_FIELDS = 115`, `RECURSIVE_PROOF_LENGTH = 410`,
`RECURSIVE_ZK_PROOF_LENGTH = 458`. **Measured on bb 1.2.0: vk = 112 fields, proof = 507.** Take the
`PROOF_TYPE_*` values from that library; take the LENGTHS from measurement.

**NEXT STEPS, in order:** (1) get noir-lang's own recursion example for beta.13 running UNCHANGED -
if it fails, the toolchain is the answer and no amount of aggregator work helps; (2) only if it
passes, diff its flags and input shapes against the minimal pair above. Superseded suspect, kept so
it is not re-tried: `std::verify_proof_with_type`'s
fourth argument is the hash of the inner verification key. A wrong value need not fail witness
SOLVING (the recursion constraints are discharged by the backend, and `nargo execute` succeeded),
but would produce an unsatisfied constraint the prover then cannot prove — which is exactly the
observed shape: witness solves, fold matches, outer proof fails sumcheck. Next step is to obtain the
real vk hash rather than guess: check whether bb emits one alongside `write_vk`, or compute it the
way Aztec does (poseidon2 over the 112 vk fields) and confirm against a known-good recursion example
before touching the aggregator again.
**Do not treat the circuit as working until `bb verify` accepts a proof.**

**WHAT THE BIG BOX IS ACTUALLY FOR: `bb prove` AT N=16, AND NOTHING ELSE (measured 2026-08-01).**

| step at **N=16** | on this 16 GB box |
|---|---|
| `nargo compile` | ✅ 3 s |
| `bb gates` (11,610,552) | ✅ |
| `bb write_vk` | ✅ **116 MB peak** - write_vk is NOT proportional to circuit size the way proving is |
| `bb write_solidity_verifier` | ✅ (needs only the vk) |
| generated verifier under EIP-170 + `forge test` of the contract side | ✅ |
| **`bb prove`** | ❌ **~27 GB** |

So the ENTIRE contract-side path - generating the real N=16 verifier, checking it fits EIP-170, and
forge-testing the batch entrypoint - can be done here. Only producing an actual N=16 proof cannot.

### THE SECOND JOB FOR THE SAME BIG BOX: three passport verifiers (2026-08-03)

**Park these two together - they are the only work in this repo blocked purely on RAM.** Different
step, same answer: a machine with more memory. Everything else about both is finished and proven.

**WHAT IS LEFT:** three of the 75 recovered passport profiles could not be regenerated here.
```
25_384_3_5_576_248_20_3768_3_2008
27_512_3_4_336_248_NA
28_384_3_3_576_264_24_2024_4_2792
```
Their `.sol` are UNTOUCHED - still rarimo's stale beta.1 UltraPlonk verifiers, unusable either way -
so nothing regressed by leaving them. **72 of 75 are done**, committed and validated.

**AND NOTE THE CONTRAST WITH THE TABLE ABOVE**, because it is counter-intuitive and will mislead the
next person: at N=16 `bb write_vk` peaks at **116 MB** and only `bb prove` needs the big box. For
these passport circuits it is **`write_vk` itself** that cannot run - even `bb gates` is OOM-killed.
The reason is blackbox expansion: `write_vk` constructs the circuit to expand ACIR blackbox opcodes,
and a full ICAO chain (RSA-4096 / ECDSA-P521 / SHA-512 in-circuit) expands to far more than the
aggregation circuit's 11.6M gates. **"write_vk is cheap" is true of aggregation, not universally.**

**IT IS NOT A NARROW MISS, AND MORE GiB ON A 16 GB HOST WILL NOT DO IT.** bb expands to fill whatever
it is given and is then killed:

| Docker VM | peak reached | % of VM |
|---|---|---|
| 11.7 GiB | 11.2 GiB | 96% |
| 12.68 GiB | 12.09 GiB | 95% |

The kernel's own record is the authority - `task=bb, global_oom, anon-rss:11690980kB,
total-vm:20322528kB` - and that **~19.4 GiB of address space** is what it actually wants. A 16 GB
host cannot host it: macOS wired memory alone is ~3.0 GiB and cannot be swapped, so a 14 GiB VM
already exceeds the machine (14 + 3 > 16).

**EVERY LEVER WAS TRIED AND MEASURED. DO NOT RETRY THESE:**
- `HARDWARE_CONCURRENCY=2` - bb honours it (`num threads: 2`); **peak unchanged**. Memory is set by
  the polynomials (2^25 x 32 bytes each), not by parallelism.
- `BB_STORAGE_BUDGET` - **no effect**. An earlier claim that it cut 9.7 GB to 5.3 GB was a FALSE
  POSITIVE from comparing two DIFFERENT circuits.
- `--cpuset-cpus` - **silently ignored**; bb reads host CPU count and still reported 8 threads.
- **VM swap does not rescue it.** With 3 GiB of swap the kernel OOM-killed while **2.7 GiB was still
  FREE**: the allocation outruns reclaim. Swap saves idle pages, not a fast-growing working set.
- Pre-seeding a 2^25 CRS - bb dies before it reaches the CRS (the file's mtime proves it untouched).
- `docker stats` at 10 s intervals **missed the spike entirely** (read 6.9 GiB on a container that
  died at 11.2). Sample at <=5 s, or read `dmesg` in the VM, which is what settled this.

**WHAT IS ALREADY BUILT AND PROVEN, so the big box only has to run it:**
- `backend/circuits/passport-verifiers.Dockerfile` - stock nargo 1.0.0-beta.26 + bb 5.1.0, pins
  verified at image build time. Stock nargo is correct here and produces a BYTE-IDENTICAL artifact to
  our patched compiler (md5 8ea5345bad87c71a45808ae4b6179c99).
- `backend/circuits/build-passport-verifiers-docker.sh` - refuses to start on an under-provisioned VM
  rather than letting bb be OOM-killed with no diagnostic.
- **Cross-platform determinism is PROVEN**: profile `11_256_3_2_336_216_NA` built in the container
  reproduces the macOS-built verifier byte for byte (md5 351cc246cffaebe5a1b3dcf62b187b86). So
  whatever the big box emits is consistent with the 72 built here.
- `backend/circuits/passport-profiles.json` carries all 75 recovered parameter tuples.

**TO FINISH, ON A HOST WITH >=32 GB (about 20 minutes):**
```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f backend/circuits/passport-verifiers.Dockerfile \
  -t ibiza-passport-verifiers:beta26-bb5.1.0 backend/circuits
backend/circuits/build-passport-verifiers-docker.sh   # its default list is exactly these three
```
Then on any machine: the structural validation (75 distinct bodies, distinct VK_HASH, renamed
contracts, NUMBER_OF_PUBLIC_INPUTS = 13), `forge build --sizes`, `forge test`.

**Seed the CRS volume first if the download is slow** - it needs 2^25 points and bb will otherwise
fetch and decompress ~2 GiB per cold container:
```sh
curl -L --range 0-2147483647 -o bn254_g1.dat http://crs.aztec-cdn.foundation/g1.dat
docker run --rm -v ibiza-bb-crs:/crs -v "$PWD":/host ubuntu:24.04 cp /host/bn254_g1.dat /crs/
```

**NOTHING IS HARDWIRED TO 16.** `BATCH_N` is a single global (`src/main.nr:38`); every array
dimension and loop bound derives from it, and the pinned inner key is `withdraw_identity`'s
112-field vk, which is independent of N. So a smaller N is the SAME circuit with fewer iterations,
and N=2 validating the construction (recursion API shape, fold, order-binding, range checks, against
two REAL proofs) carries over unchanged.

**The one thing only N=16 can exercise** is proving at that size, where the padded circuit crosses
into a larger power of two (N=2 pads to ~2^21, N=16 to ~2^24) and needs correspondingly more CRS.
That is a resource/config difference, not a logic one - but it is the reason "it verified at N=2"
is not the same claim as "it verifies at N=16".

**THE TREE (N>16) IS GENUINELY NEW CODE, not a bigger N.** A tree node aggregates AGGREGATION proofs,
so its pinned inner key becomes the aggregator's OWN vk - self-recursion, a different constant and a
different circuit. It also does not need the big box to validate: a depth-2 tree of 2x2 = 4 exercises
the whole construction.

**PROVING N=16 NEEDS ~25 GB — not possible on this machine (16 GB).** Measured 3.3 GB peak at N=2;
scaling by gates gives ~25 GB at N=16 (better than sec. 2.4b's 56 GB estimate, which assumed
3.4 KB/gate and 16M gates). N=16 COMPILES and gate-counts here; only proving needs the big box.

**🔴 MEASURED 2026-08-01 — THE POSEIDON FOLD COSTS 287,969 GAS/WITHDRAWAL ON-CHAIN. THE HASH
CHOICE MUST BE REVISITED BEFORE THE BATCH ENTRYPOINT IS BUILT.**

`BatchCommitmentLib` is written, and `BatchCommitmentTest` proves it reproduces the CIRCUIT's value
exactly (5 tests: fixture match, every one of the 112 signal positions bound, order-binding,
length-binding, empty batch). The cross-language agreement is real. **The economics are not.**

| | gas/withdrawal |
|---|---|
| single withdrawal today | ~3,113,864 |
| sec. 2.4b target at N=16 | ~152,846 |
| **the Poseidon recompute ALONE** | **287,969** (4,607,508 for a batch of 16; ~144k per PoseidonT6/T5 hash, 2 per withdrawal) |

So the fold would be **65% of the total cost** and nearly 2x the whole budget - aggregation still
beats 3.1M, but lands near ~440k instead of ~152k, throwing away most of the saving.

**MY REASONING WAS BACKWARDS.** I chose Poseidon v1 because it is cheap IN-CIRCUIT and matches
`poseidon-solidity`. But the fold is **0.34% of the circuit** (39,037 of 11,610,552 gates), so
in-circuit cost was never the binding constraint - **on-chain cost is**, and Poseidon is brutal there
while keccak is nearly free.

**THE CANDIDATE FIX: fold with keccak256 instead.** On-chain, 16x7 = 112 words is ~3.6 KB, i.e. a
few thousand gas TOTAL rather than 4.6M. In-circuit it is the reverse - Noir keccak is roughly 150k
gates per 136-byte block, so ~27 blocks is ~4M gates, a ~34% circuit increase (11.6M -> ~15.6M) and
proving memory ~27 GB -> ~36 GB. **That trade is strongly worth making** and it is exactly the trade
the pool's own `context` signal already makes (keccak256 computed on-chain, consumed as a field).

**THE CHECK IS DONE (2026-08-01) - THE COST IS REAL, AND ITS CAUSE IS IDENTIFIED.** Measured per
hash, isolated (`test/pool/PoseidonGas.t.sol`): **T3 = 32,549 · T5 = 119,897 · T6 = 172,475**. So
T6+T5 = 292,372/withdrawal, matching the 287,969 measured through the fold.

**Raising `optimizer_runs` for `lib/poseidon-solidity` changes NOTHING** (tried at 4294967295,
scoped by `compilation_restrictions`; identical gas to the byte). The restriction was reverted rather
than left in place pretending to help. **The cause is not optimisation:**
1. Every entry point is declared `function hash(uint[2] memory) **public** pure` - a PUBLIC library
   function, so each call is a `DELEGATECALL` into a deployed-and-linked library, not an inlined
   internal call. `internal` would inline it.
2. The file's own header calls itself a *simplified* implementation and points at a separate
   optimised one (`vimwitch/poseidon-solidity/contracts/Poseidon.sol`). The ~1,283 gas figure
   advertised for T3 belongs to that variant, not the one vendored here.

**THIS IS NOT AN AGGREGATOR PROBLEM - IT IS REPO-WIDE.** Every Poseidon call in `PoseidonSMT`,
`StateKeeper`, `IdentityRegistry`, `HolderStateKeeper` and `TitleLedger` pays 32.5k per 2-input hash.
An SMT insert at depth 32 is ~32 hashes = **over 1M gas**. Whatever is decided for the fold, swapping
in an `internal`/assembly Poseidon is likely one of the largest single gas wins available in this
repo, and it needs measuring in its own right.

**🔴 RETRACTED 2026-08-01 — INLINING poseidon-solidity IS UNSAFE. The 11x measurement was real; the
conclusion drawn from it was wrong.** Making `hash` `internal` and migrating `Poseidon.sol` to it
**broke 31 tests**, with hashes returning ZERO
(`test_ZeroValueLeafMatchesTheCircuitRoot`: `0x0000... != 0x22cc...`). Reverted; 404 tests green again.
The inline copies, their generator and their differential suite were DELETED rather than left as a
trap.

**ROOT CAUSE - the library reads FIXED MEMORY ADDRESSES.** `PoseidonT3.sol:22-23`:
```
let state1 := add(mod(mload(0x80), F), ...)
let state2 := add(mod(mload(0xa0), F), ...)
```
`0x80` is where Solidity's ABI decoder places arguments **when the function is the callee of an
EXTERNAL call**. That is a hidden precondition of being `public`. Inlined, the arguments live wherever
the caller's memory layout puts them, so it hashes whatever happens to sit at `0x80`.

**WHY THE DIFFERENTIAL SUITE PASSED ANYWAY - a test that was green for the wrong reason.** It called
the inlined library as the FIRST allocation in a trivial test body, so the array landed at `0x80` by
coincidence and the hidden precondition was accidentally satisfied. Eight tests, five arities, 512
fuzz runs, all passing, all meaningless for the property that mattered. **The lesson generalises:
a differential test must exercise the function in a REALISTIC CALLER, not in isolation** - isolation
is exactly the condition that can satisfy an unstated assumption.

**✅✅ THE GAS PROBLEM IS SOLVED: FOLD WITH KECCAK. MEASURED 2026-08-01, and my own estimate was
8x too pessimistic.**

| fold | in-circuit gates | on-chain gas/withdrawal |
|---|---|---|
| Poseidon v1 (as built) | 39,037 | **287,969** |
| **keccak256** | **550,220** | **~200** (one keccak over 3,584 bytes for the WHOLE batch) |

**+511,183 gates on an 11,610,552-gate circuit = +4.4%** - not the ~34% guessed earlier. Proving memory
moves ~27 GB -> ~28 GB, which changes nothing about what hardware is needed. In exchange the on-chain
recompute collapses from 4,607,508 gas per batch to a couple of thousand.

**So sec. 2.4b's ~152,846 gas/withdrawal target is ACHIEVABLE** - the fold stops being a factor
(~153k all-in) instead of being 65% of the cost. Measured with
`keccak256 = { tag = "v0.1.0", git = "https://github.com/noir-lang/keccak256" }`; `std::hash::keccak256`
does NOT exist on beta.13.

**WHY POSEIDON WAS RIGHT ORIGINALLY, AND WHY THE FOLD IS THE EXCEPTION (user asked 2026-08-01).**
Poseidon is not a legacy choice - it is correct everywhere it is currently used, and must stay:
- Commitments and tree nodes are hashed **inside circuits, repeatedly**. A depth-32 SMT membership
  proof is ~32 hashes IN-CIRCUIT: ~8k constraints with Poseidon, roughly **4.8M with keccak**. That
  ratio is the entire reason ZK-friendly hashes exist.
- Tree nodes must BE field elements. Poseidon outputs one natively; keccak outputs 256 bits that
  must be reduced, so every node would carry a reduction step.
- The circuit, the wallet and the contracts must agree on ONE commitment function
  (`pp/src/commitment.nr` <-> `poseidon-solidity`). Changing it forks every existing note.

**The fold is the one place the trade inverts**: it is ONE hash per BATCH (not per tree level), it is
computed once in-circuit and once on-chain, and it sits inside a circuit that is 99.7% recursive
verification. So in-circuit cost is irrelevant there and on-chain cost is everything - the exact
opposite of the tree case. **This is a local exception, not a migration**: nothing else changes hash,
and the fold has no existing consumers to fork.

**IS KECCAK THE BEST OF ALL AVAILABLE HASHES, OR JUST THE FIRST ONE TRIED? (user asked 2026-08-01)**
The fold's requirements are unusual and they narrow the field hard: cheap **on-chain** (the binding
constraint), tolerable in-circuit, output reducible to a field element, collision-resistant.

| candidate | on-chain | in-circuit (112 fields) | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **keccak256** | **native opcode, 30 + 6/word (~2k for the batch)** | **550,220 gates (MEASURED)** | **CHOSEN** |
| sha256 | precompile 0x02, 60 + 12/word - 2x keccak, plus call overhead | not measurable: `sha256` v0.1.2 **fails to build on beta.13** ("constants is private") | rejected - dearer on-chain AND does not compile |
| Poseidon v1 | **287,969/withdrawal** (measured) | 39,037 | rejected - 65% of the whole gas budget |
| Poseidon2 | same order as v1; no audited Solidity implementation exists | cheaper than v1 | rejected - dear on-chain, and new trusted code |
| Pedersen | elliptic-curve ops on-chain, far dearer than Poseidon | very cheap | rejected |
| MiMC | field-heavy, same class as Poseidon | cheap | rejected |
| blake2s | **no matching precompile** - EVM's 0x09 is blake2**b** | cheap | rejected - no on-chain path |

**keccak wins on the axis that actually binds**, and by a margin nothing else approaches: it is the
only candidate that is a NATIVE EVM OPCODE, so it has no precompile-call overhead and the lowest
per-word cost available. Its in-circuit cost is paid by the batcher, where 4.4% is noise. That it is
also already the hash `PrivacyPool` uses for `context` (same keccak-then-reduce pattern, same file)
means it introduces no new primitive to this system at all.

**This is a decision, not a default:** the alternatives were enumerated and priced, and two of them
(sha256, blake2s) were eliminated by facts that would not have been guessed - one does not compile on
our pinned toolchain, the other has no EVM precompile in its variant.

**WHO PAYS THE +511k GATES, AND WHY IT IS THE RIGHT PARTY (user asked 2026-08-01).**
The fold is in the AGGREGATION circuit, which only the **batcher** runs. The USER proves only
`withdraw_identity` - 44,176 gates, ~1.3 s desktop, 15-40 s on the A16 - and that is **completely
unchanged**. So the added cost lands on the party that already needs a ~28 GB machine and minutes of
proving, and that is paid through PP's relay fee, while the hard constraint (sec. 2.4b: user-side
proving must run on a budget phone) is untouched.

Concretely for the batcher: 11.6M -> 12.16M gates, ~27 -> ~28 GB, ~4.4% more proving time. Against
saving ~288k gas on EVERY withdrawal they settle, which is what they are paid out of. The incentive
points the same way as the design.

**IT SCALES.** In a 16-wide tree (sec. 2.4b), only LEAF nodes fold raw signals; a parent aggregates 16
leaf proofs and folds 16 field elements, not 16x7. On-chain, N=256 means keccak over ~57 KB of
calldata = ~11k gas for the whole batch, still negligible. Nothing about this choice degrades as N grows.

**"NO EXISTING CONSUMERS" - PRECISELY WHAT THAT MEANS, AND WHAT COMES LATER.**
Today `batch_commitment` and `BatchCommitmentLib` are new code with **zero callers**: the batch
entrypoint does not exist, no batcher software computes it, no wallet reads it. So changing the hash
NOW forks nothing at all. **Later there WILL be consumers** - the batch entrypoint, the batcher that
assembles batches off-chain, possibly the wallet if it checks its withdrawal was included, and any
tree implementation. **So the free window is now, before those are written.**

**BUT THE LOCK-IN IS WEAK EVEN AFTER THAT, AND THIS IS THE KEY STRUCTURAL POINT:**
the batch commitment is **TRANSIENT** - it exists for the duration of ONE transaction and is never
stored. Changing it later would invalidate only in-flight batches, not any funds or state. Contrast
the NOTE commitment (`pp/src/commitment.nr`), which is **DURABLE**: it defines leaves living in the
state tree forever, so changing that hash would strand every existing note. That difference - not
convenience - is the real reason the fold may use a different hash while the tree may not, and it is
the sentence to check any future "let us unify the hashes" proposal against.

**CONSEQUENCES OF KECCAK IN THE FOLD - checked, all bounded:**
1. **Field reduction is REQUIRED and already has precedent.** keccak gives 256 bits, BN254's field is
   ~254, so the digest must be reduced. `PrivacyPool.sol:97` already does exactly this for `context`:
   `uint256(keccak256(abi.encode(_withdrawal, SCOPE))) % Constants.SNARK_SCALAR_FIELD`. Follow it
   verbatim on both sides. Reduction leaves ~2^127 collision resistance - finding a collision still
   means breaking keccak.
2. **Byte serialisation must match exactly** (`abi.encodePacked` = 32-byte big-endian per word;
   `to_be_bytes` in-circuit). A mismatch is SILENT - which is precisely what the circuit-emitted
   fixture in `BatchCommitmentTest` exists to catch. Same risk class as today, already guarded.
3. **The public input stays ONE field**, so the verifier's 84-byte EIP-170 margin is untouched.
4. **No effect on ZK or on recursion** - it is only constraints.
5. **Calldata is unchanged** - the contract needs the signals in calldata regardless of hash choice.

**`std::hash::keccak256` IS NOT MISSING, it MOVED.** beta.13 removed it from `std` (already recorded
in `pp/Nargo.toml`'s migration note); the maintained implementation is the first-party package
`keccak256 = { tag = "v0.1.0", git = "https://github.com/noir-lang/keccak256" }`, which is what the
550,220-gate measurement used. Nothing needs building or vendoring.

**WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT TRADE AND POSEIDON IS NOT.** The circuit is 99.7% recursive verification, so
in-circuit hash cost is nearly irrelevant; the contract pays real money per hash, so on-chain cost is
everything. Poseidon is optimised for the side that does not matter here. Inlining cannot rescue it:
that is a ~3,400 gas saving against ~29,000 of inherent arithmetic per hash (see below).

**⛔ FINAL 2026-08-01: `verify_proof_with_type` DOES NOT BIND ON nargo 1.0.0-beta.13 + bb 1.2.0.
THE TOOLCHAIN CONCLUSION I RETRACTED WAS CORRECT. THE AGGREGATOR CANNOT BE FINISHED ON THIS PIN.**

Minimal pair (a 1-constraint inner circuit, a 3-line outer), `proof_type = 0`, full flag matrix,
REAL vs ALL-ZERO inner proof:

| outer flags | real proof | garbage proof |
|---|---|---|
| default (poseidon2) | verifies | **VERIFIES** |
| `--oracle_hash keccak` | no vk written | no vk written |
| `--honk_recursion 1` | no vk written | no vk written |

The only configuration that produces a verifier at all accepts garbage. `nargo execute` solves the
witness for garbage too. So the opcode is emitted and never enforced - at ANY arity, in the minimal
case as well as the aggregator.

**I RETRACTED THE RIGHT ANSWER FOR THE WRONG REASON.** Earlier this session I concluded the toolchain
was broken, then withdrew it when `proof_type = 0` made proofs verify. But *verification succeeding
was never evidence of anything* - that is precisely what a non-binding constraint produces. The
correct test was always the negative one, and had I run it then, the retraction would not have
happened. `proof_type = 0` is still RIGHT (1 is in neither position of Aztec's PROOF_TYPE_* set) - it
is just not sufficient, and it changed the failure from "cannot prove" to "proves anything".

**WHAT THIS MEANS - THE SEAMS, so nothing else is broken by accident:**
- **The aggregator is UNBUILDABLE here, not half-built.** Do NOT build the batch entrypoint, do NOT
  deploy `AggregationHonkVerifier`, do NOT migrate the wallet to a batched path.
- **NOTHING ELSE IS AFFECTED.** No other circuit uses recursion: `withdraw_identity`, `ragequit`,
  `title_holder`, `notary_action`, `escrow_envelope` are all standalone and their verifiers are
  sound. The 405-test forge suite and the Noir suites are unrelated to this. **The pool works today**
  - aggregation is an optimisation that has never been live.
- **The keccak fold decision SURVIVES and is independent.** It was decided on measured on-chain gas
  (288k -> ~200/withdrawal) and in-circuit cost paid by the batcher (+4.4%); none of that depends on
  recursion binding. Re-apply it once the toolchain works. Note the keccak version ALSO dropped the
  constraints entirely (81,668 gates vs 1,396,874) - so on a working toolchain, re-verify the fold
  choice with the garbage test before trusting it.
- **`AggregationHonkVerifier.sol` is generated from a circuit that does not bind.** It is committed
  and compiles at 24,492 bytes, and is currently MEANINGLESS. Regenerate it from scratch after the
  toolchain is fixed; do not treat the EIP-170 measurement as transferable (the gate count will
  change once recursion is real, though sec. 2.4pre's N-independence claim suggests the SIZE will not).

**✅ AGGREGATION LANDED 2026-08-01 (commit `e2ecd88`) - AND IT CREATED A SPLIT TOOLCHAIN THAT MUST BE
CLOSED BEFORE ANYTHING IS DEPLOYED. Read both halves.**

**WHAT LANDED.** The aggregator BINDS its inner proofs: two REAL `withdraw_identity` proofs are
ACCEPTED, an all-zero batch is REFUSED at prove. On bb 1.2.0 both were accepted. `pp` 87/87,
`withdraw_identity` 5/5, `aggregate_withdrawals` 5/5, all on **nargo beta.26 + bb 5.1.0**.

**THE UNLOCK was that the aggregation path is INDEPENDENT of the crates that crash beta.26.**
`withdraw_identity` -> `pp` -> `poseidon`, full stop; the `noir_dl_lib` references inside `pp` are
COMMENTS about copied code, not dependencies. Three crates needed migrating, not the whole repo.

**Changes:** `poseidon` v0.2.0 -> v0.3.0, `keccak256` v0.1.0 -> v0.1.3, the `u1` -> `bool` rewrite in
`pp`/`withdraw_identity`/`notary_action`, and the aggregator retargeted to the REAL recursion shapes -
vk **115** (was 112), proof **458** (was 507), `proof_type` **6** = `PROOF_TYPE_HONK_ZK` (was 0, which
expects a NON-ZK 410-field proof - the original root cause).

**✅ MIGRATION COMPLETED 2026-08-01 - VERIFIERS AND BUNDLED CIRCUITS ALL REGENERATED ON bb 5.x.**
The repo is no longer mid-migration on the PP side.

**🎁 THE BIG UNADVERTISED WIN: THE EIP-170 KNIFE-EDGE IS GONE.** bb 5.x emits verifiers ~30% smaller:

| verifier | beta.13 / bb 1.2.0 | beta.26 / bb 5.1.0 | margin |
|---|---|---|---|
| Withdrawal | 24,491 | **17,162** | 85 -> **7,414** |
| Ragequit | ~24,491 | **17,097** | -> **7,479** |
| TitleHolder | ~24,491 | **17,098** | -> **7,478** |
| NotaryAction | ~24,491 | **18,051** | -> **6,525** |
| **Aggregation (N=16)** | 24,492 | **17,723** | 84 -> **6,853** |

Every warning in this repo about "85 bytes of headroom" and "a circuit whose public-input count grows
WILL push a verifier over EIP-170" is **obsolete on this toolchain**. `optimizer_runs = 1` is likely
no longer needed for these files either - worth re-testing, since it was chosen for SIZE over
execution cost and may be costing gas for nothing.

**WALLET-BUNDLED CIRCUITS REFRESHED** (they shrank, so they genuinely changed - a stale bundle would
have broken on-device proving with nothing pointing at the cause):
`withdraw_identity` 3,128,023 -> 2,267,990 · `notary_action` 1,572,014 -> 1,149,600 ·
`title_holder` 354,642 -> 345,868 · `ragequit` 157,454 -> 144,636 bytes.

**📉 PROOFS SHRANK TOO - A SECOND UNADVERTISED WIN.** bb 5.x proofs are ~44% smaller:
`withdraw_identity` **507 -> 286 fields** (16,224 -> 9,152 bytes), `ragequit` -> 226, `title_holder`
-> 250, `notary_action` -> 262. **Proof bytes are CALLDATA**, so this is a direct per-withdrawal gas
saving on top of aggregation, and it also changes sec. 2.4b's gas model, whose calldata term was
computed from 507-field proofs. **Re-derive that table before quoting it.**

**✅✅ MIGRATION COMPLETE 2026-08-01: 405 forge tests pass, 0 fail. Nothing is left mid-migration on
the PP side.**

**⚠️ MY "FULLY CHARACTERISED" ROOT CAUSE WAS WRONG - correcting it in place.** I claimed bb 5.1.0's
`write_solidity_verifier` and `prove` disagreed about proof length, and called it a toolchain defect.
It was not. **I had misread the error's argument order**: `ProofLengthWrongWithLogN(logN, actual,
expected)` reports what it GOT first. So it got **16,224** - a STALE fixture - and expected 9,152.
bb 5.x was self-consistent throughout.

**THE ACTUAL CAUSE: four fixtures I never regenerated**, because the tests read files whose names do
not match the circuit's: `withdraw_e2e.proof`, `withdraw_identity_wallet.proof`, `ragequit_e2e.proof`
and `title_holder_id1.proof` - each proved from its OWN witness (`Prover.e2e.toml`,
`Prover.wallet.toml`, `Prover.titleid1.toml`). I regenerated only the four `<circuit>.proof` files and
assumed that was the set. **Listing the fixture directory with sizes found it in one command** - the
stale ones were still exactly 16,224 bytes while the new ones were 7-9k.

**THE LESSON, which cost four wrong diagnoses:** when a fixture-driven test fails, LIST THE FIXTURES
WITH THEIR SIZES before theorising about the toolchain. And read the error signature's argument
ORDER - I built three hypotheses on top of one inverted reading.

**FINAL STATE (beta.26 + bb 5.1.0, PP side):** `pp` 87/87 · `withdraw_identity` 5/5 ·
`aggregate_withdrawals` 5/5 · `notary_action` 5/5 · `ragequit` 3/3 · **forge 405/405** · aggregation
proven sound (garbage batches REFUSED) · verifiers ~30% smaller (EIP-170 margin 85 -> ~7,400) ·
proofs ~44% smaller (507 -> 286 fields, direct calldata saving) · wallet bundles refreshed.
Passport circuits remain on beta.13, blocked by an upstream compiler crash and unaffected.

**🎯 ONE TOOLCHAIN IS THE GOAL AND IT IS CLOSER THAN THE EARLIER NOTES SAID - retested 2026-08-01.**

**MY "UPSTREAM COMPILER BUG BLOCKS THE PASSPORT CIRCUITS" CLAIM WAS HALF WRONG.** With poseidon
v0.3.0 + the `u1`->`bool` rewrite + a CLEAN `target/`, **`noir_dl_lib` COMPILES ON beta.26 WITH ZERO
ERRORS**, as do `escrow_envelope`, `query_identity`, `query_identity_td1` and
`register_identity_light_td1`. My earlier failure was stale build state plus an un-upgraded poseidon
pin, not the compiler.

**WHAT ACTUALLY CRASHES IS `nargo test`, NOT `nargo compile`.** All five build their artifacts fine
and then ICE on TEST compilation:
`ice: all function ids should have metadata` (`noirc_frontend/src/node_interner/function.rs:176`),
with **no source location** - the message names the compiler's own file, not ours.

**SO ONE TOOLCHAIN IS ALREADY POSSIBLE FOR EVERY DEPLOYABLE ARTIFACT** - every circuit compiles on
beta.26 and every verifier can be generated from it. The ONLY thing standing in the way is that the
passport crates would lose their test suites (80 in `noir_dl_lib` alone), which is not an acceptable
trade. **The passport circuits were therefore left on beta.13 SOLELY to keep them testable**, not
because they cannot build on beta.26.

**🔬 BISECT RESULT 2026-08-01: THE CRASH IS NOT IN ANY TEST BODY. Do not bisect test functions -
that was my recommendation and it is WRONG.**

Disabled **every** `#[test]` attribute across all 17 test-bearing files in `noir_dl_lib`
(`#[test]` -> `//BISECT-OFF #[test]`), leaving ZERO test functions. **`nargo test` STILL ICEs**
(`all function ids should have metadata`, then a scoped-thread panic at
`nargo_cli/src/cli/test_cmd.rs:577`).

**So the trigger is in TEST-MODE COMPILATION ITSELF, independent of test functions existing.**
`nargo compile` succeeds on the same source; only `nargo test` crashes. That rules out the entire
class of "some test uses a construct beta.26 dislikes".

**⚠️ MODULE-DELETION BISECTION DOES NOT WORK HERE - I proposed it and it fails.** Commenting out the
first 8 of the 15 `mod` declarations in `lib.nr` produced ordinary COMPILE ERRORS, not a crash,
because the remaining modules DEPEND on the removed ones. So "did the crash go away?" is unanswerable
that way - you cannot tell a fixed crash from a crate that no longer type-checks.

**WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY WORK** - build UP, not down: start a fresh crate containing ONE module plus its
dependencies, confirm `nargo test` succeeds, then add modules until it crashes. Slower per step but
every step gives a clean yes/no. Alternatively reduce OUTSIDE this crate: the ICE is in
`noirc_frontend`'s test-mode pass, so a minimal reproduction built from scratch (a few generics /
comptime constructs) may hit it faster than shrinking a ~16k-line vendored library, and that
reproduction is also what an upstream issue needs.

**ELIMINATED SO FAR (2026-08-01) - do not re-test these:**
1. **All `#[test]` bodies.** Disabled every `#[test]` attribute across all 17 test-bearing files -
   ZERO test functions remained - and `nargo test` still ICEd.
2. **The two vendored test-support modules.** Commented out `pub(crate) mod derive_offset_generators;`
   (`src/big_curve/utils.nr:2`) and `pub(crate) mod u60_representation_test;`
   (`src/bignum/utils/mod.nr:3`). Still ICEd.

So the trigger is neither a test function nor the obvious vendored test helpers. It is something in
the ordinary library source that only the TEST-MODE compilation pass walks.

**WHERE TO LOOK INSTEAD** - the search space is now different and much smaller:
- `#[cfg(test)]` modules and any test-only `use`/helper that compiles only under test mode.
- The VENDORED test-support code sitting in `src/`, not in a test module:
  `src/bignum/utils/u60_representation_test.nr` and
  `src/big_curve/utils/derive_offset_generators.nr` are compiled as ordinary modules and are the
  most likely carriers of a comptime/generic construct that only the test-mode pass walks.
- Bisect by MODULE DECLARATION (comment out `mod ...;` lines in `lib.nr`/parents), not by `#[test]`.

**This also means the passport circuits' PRODUCTION artifacts are unaffected** - they compile cleanly
on beta.26. Only `nargo test` is unusable there, so the coverage loss is the whole cost, and a
one-toolchain build for deployment is already achievable today.

**TO CLOSE IT - isolate the ICE, which is bounded work:** the crash has no source location, so bisect
`noir_dl_lib`'s test bodies - comment out `#[test]` modules by half until it compiles, then narrow to
the construct. Prime suspects given the message: generic or comptime-heavy test helpers, and the
vendored `bignum`/`big_curve` test code. Once that construct is rewritten, beta.26 covers the whole
repo and the split disappears. **Do NOT conclude "upstream bug" again without doing this bisect - I
made that call twice today and was wrong both times.**

**REMAINING:** `codegen-verifiers.sh` still guards beta.13 + bb 1.2.0 and uses the old CLI. It must
learn the bb 5.x flags (`-t evm`, `-t noir-recursive`, no `--scheme`/`--oracle_hash`) and TWO
toolchains - and its TARGETS list must cover EVERY fixture, not one per circuit, which is precisely
the gap that caused today's four wrong diagnoses.

**🔬 SUPERSEDED (kept so the wrong reasoning is visible)**

All eight throw `ProofLengthWrongWithLogN(logN, 16224, <actual>)`, across `WithdrawEndToEnd` (6),
`WithdrawalHonkVerifier` (1) and `TitleLedger` (1). Facts:

- The **regenerated** verifiers ARE the ones running: their `LOG_N` differs per circuit
  (withdraw 17, ragequit 12, title_holder 14, notary_action 15) and each error reports its own logN.
- They are the **ZK** flavour (`is BaseZKHonkVerifier`), consistent with `-t evm` = "keccak, ZK".
- **Yet every one expects 16,224 bytes = 507 fields**, which is the bb **1.2.0** proof length.
- bb 5.x's own `prove` emits **286 fields** with `-t evm` and **254** with `-t evm-no-zk`.
  **Neither is 507.**

So `write_solidity_verifier` and `prove` in bb 5.1.0 disagree about proof length for the same key and
target. That is the whole bug, and it is NOT: a stale file (LOG_N proves regeneration), a ZK/non-ZK
mismatch on the verifier side (it is ZK, and neither ZK nor non-ZK gives 507), the pairing order
(vk/verifier/proof were rebuilt from one artifact with `bb verify` passing natively), or a missing
`-t evm` (added, no change).

**WHERE TO LOOK NEXT** (do not re-run the four things above): (1) whether `write_solidity_verifier`
needs the vk written by a DIFFERENT target than the one used for `prove`; (2) whether it takes an
extra flag pinning the proof shape - check `write_solidity_verifier --help-extended`; (3) whether
bb 5.1.0 has a known defect here, since 507 is precisely the OLD library's length and looks like a
stale default compiled into the generator. **`bb verify` accepts these proofs natively**, so the
proofs and keys are good and only the generated Solidity disagrees.

**🔧 EARLIER STATE (superseded): 397 forge tests pass, 8 fail** - all with
`ProofLengthWrongWithLogN(14, 16224, 8000)`, i.e. a deployed verifier still expecting the OLD
507-field (16,224-byte) proof while the fixture is the new one. **This is a PAIRING error, not a
soundness problem:** some verifiers were regenerated BEFORE their circuit was recompiled, so the
`.sol` and the `.proof` come from different builds. **The fix is to regenerate vk -> verifier ->
proof from ONE artifact in a single pass per circuit, never interleaved** - which is exactly what
`codegen-verifiers.sh` does and why it must be updated rather than worked around by hand. Do that
first; do not hand-patch fixtures.

**STILL OUTSTANDING, and it is now a SHORT list:**
1. `codegen-verifiers.sh` still GUARDS beta.13 + bb 1.2.0 and uses `--oracle_hash keccak`/`--scheme`.
   It must be taught the bb 5.x CLI (`-t evm`, `-t noir-recursive`) and TWO toolchains, or it will
   refuse to run and, if forced, regenerate stale artifacts.
2. The passport circuits (`noir_dl_lib`, `escrow_envelope`, `query_*`, `register_*`) remain on
   beta.13 - blocked by the upstream compiler crash, unaffected by this work.
3. Re-run the on-chain proof fixtures: `test/fixtures/*.proof` were produced by bb 1.2.0 and the
   regenerated verifiers will reject them. **`forge test` will fail until they are regenerated with
   bb 5.x** - that is expected, not a regression.

**🔴 SUPERSEDED CONSEQUENCE (now addressed): `bb` 1.2.0 CANNOT READ THE beta.26 ARTIFACT** - it errors
`Length is too large`. So:
- **`WithdrawalHonkVerifier.sol` as deployed WILL REJECT proofs from the beta.26-built circuit.** It
  was generated from the beta.13/bb-1.2.0 build. It MUST be regenerated with `bb` 5.x (`-t evm`) and
  re-checked against EIP-170 - it had only ~85 bytes of margin and 5.x codegen may differ.
- **The wallet's bundled `withdraw_identity.circuit` must be refreshed too**, or on-device proofs will
  not verify against the new verifier. `codegen-verifiers.sh` already copies it; that script's
  toolchain GUARD still pins beta.13 + 1.2.0 and is now WRONG for this path.
- `ragequit`, `title_holder`, `notary_action` share `pp`, so they are on the beta.26 side as well and
  their verifiers need the same treatment. The PASSPORT circuits (`noir_dl_lib`, `escrow_envelope`,
  `query_*`, `register_*`) remain on beta.13 and are unaffected.

**SO THE HONEST STATUS: aggregation is UNBLOCKED and PROVEN SOUND, but the repo is mid-migration.**
Nothing is deployable until every beta.26-side verifier is regenerated with bb 5.x and
`codegen-verifiers.sh` is updated to drive two toolchains (or the passport circuits are migrated too,
which needs the upstream compiler crash fixed). **Do not deploy from this state.**

**🧭 IT IS A TWO-DIMENSIONAL COMPATIBILITY MATRIX (nargo x poseidon), NOT A SINGLE BISECT.**
Measured 2026-08-01. "ICE" below means **Internal Compiler Error - the compiler CRASHING**. It is a
failure, never a goal.

| nargo | poseidon | result |
|---|---|---|
| **beta.13** | **v0.2.0** | ✅ **CURRENT AND WORKING** - 7/7 circuits compile, 167/167 tests pass |
| beta.13 | v0.3.0 | ❌ `Expected an expression but found '@'` (poseidon too NEW) |
| beta.16 | v0.3.0 | ❌ 70 errors, e.g. `Could not resolve 'wrapping_add'` (poseidon too NEW) |
| beta.20 | v0.3.0 | ❌ 65 errors, same shape |
| beta.26 | v0.2.0 | ❌ `Comptime global RATE` (poseidon too OLD) |
| **beta.26** | **v0.3.0** | ⚠️ 6/7 compile, `pp` **87/87 PASSES**, but `noir_dl_lib` tests and `escrow_envelope` **CRASH the compiler** |

So poseidon v0.3.0 needs a nargo NEWER than beta.20, and beta.26 crashes. **The untested cells are the
intermediate poseidon tags** - v0.2.1 through v0.2.6 exist - paired with beta.21..beta.25. One of
those may satisfy both. That is the search, and it is mechanical: for each pair, apply the five known
source fixes and run `./verify-migration.sh`, which passes only on `RESULT: no coverage lost`.

**WHY AGGREGATION CANNOT SHIP ON beta.13 (the user asked why this matters):** recursion's
`verify_proof_with_type` **does not bind** there - proven by the soundness harness, where bb 1.2.0
accepts a batch of all-zero garbage proofs. An aggregator built on it would accept ANY claimed
withdrawal. Aggregation therefore requires a toolchain where recursion binds, and the only one proven
to bind so far is beta.26 + bb 5.x - which crashes on two of our crates. **That is the entire
deadlock, stated plainly.**

**THE THREE WAYS OUT, in order of expected cost:**
1. **Search the matrix above** (poseidon v0.2.1-v0.2.6 x nargo beta.21-25). Cheapest if a cell works.
2. **Report the crash upstream** with a reduction from `noir_dl_lib` - it has persisted beta.22 ->
   beta.26 and will not fix itself.
3. **Remove the crash's cause locally**: the crash is in `noir_dl_lib`, which is VENDORED rarimo code
   carrying `bignum`/`big_curve` dependencies. If the crashing construct can be isolated and rewritten,
   beta.26 becomes usable. `escrow_envelope` crashes too, so check whether both share one root cause.

**⛔ AN UPSTREAM COMPILER BUG, NOT OUR CODE, NOT OUR CODE (2026-08-01). This is the end of
what can be done locally.**

`noir_dl_lib`'s 80 tests do not vanish because of `u1`/`bool` - they vanish because **`nargo test`
ICEs**:

```
ice: all function ids should have metadata
compiler/noirc_frontend/src/node_interner/function.rs:176
```

**That is the SAME ICE `codegen-verifiers.sh` records for beta.22+, and it is STILL PRESENT at
beta.26.** It also causes the `escrow_envelope` compile failure. So both remaining blockers are one
upstream bug, and there is no source change on our side that clears them.

**OUR MIGRATION WORK IS COMPLETE AND CORRECT.** With poseidon v0.3.0 + beta.26 + the five source
fixes: **6 of 7 circuits compile and `pp` passes 87/87**. The `u1` -> `bool` rewrite is done and
behaviour-preserving as far as any test we can run shows.

**THE OPTIONS, none of which are more local editing:**
1. **Report the ICE upstream** with a reduction from `noir_dl_lib` (it has survived at least beta.22
   -> beta.26, so it is unlikely to fix itself). This is the honest path.
2. **Bisect beta.14..beta.25** for a version that has BOTH working recursion (`proof_type = 6` +
   115/458 field sizes) AND no ICE. Mechanical but slow; `noirup --version` makes each step cheap,
   and `verify-migration.sh` judges each one.
3. **Stay on beta.13 and accept no aggregation.** The pool works today; aggregation is the
   optimisation that has never been live.

**DO NOT attempt more `u1`/`bool` edits** - that work is finished, and the failure it appeared to
cause was always this ICE wearing a different mask (a crashed `nargo test` produces no test names,
which the gate correctly reports as "all 80 dropped").

**🚦 MIGRATION RUN 2 (2026-08-01) - 6/7 COMPILE, `pp` 87/87 GREEN, BUT ALL 80 `noir_dl_lib` TESTS
VANISHED. Reverted. THE REMAINING WORK IS NOW EXACTLY ONE THING.**

`./verify-migration.sh` output: `pp` ✅ all 87 present and green; `noir_dl_lib` ❌ **TESTS SILENTLY
DROPPED (80)** - the ENTIRE suite. `nargo compile` for that crate PASSED, because **`nargo compile`
does not build `#[test]` code**. So the library compiles, the circuits that depend on it compile, and
80 tests - `sigver` ECDSA across 8 curves, `rsa`/`rsa_pss`, `sha1/224/384/512`, `jubjub`, `smt`,
`query` disclosure - simply stop existing. **Nothing except this gate would have shown that.**

**THE FIVE SOURCE FIXES ARE NOW COMPLETE AND KNOWN-GOOD** - 6 of 7 circuits compile with them, and
`pp` passes 87/87, which is strong evidence the SMT rewrite preserves behaviour. Encoded as a
repeatable script (see the run below); the two forms that caused repeat rounds are:
- the `== 1` may sit on the **CLOSING line** of a multi-line call (`) == 1,`), not on the line naming
  the function - a filter keyed on `smt_verifier` misses it;
- args may be packed onto ONE line (`REF_ROOT, 5, 0, 5, 0, 1, 1,`) as well as one-per-line, and
  `smt_verifier_full`'s **args 4-5 stay `Field`** while **6-7 become `bool`**.

**WHAT REMAINS - a single, bounded task:** make `noir_dl_lib`'s TEST code compile on beta.26. Run
`cd noir_dl_lib && nargo test 2>&1 | grep -m5 error` to get the list; it will be the same `u1`/`bool`
shapes inside `#[test]` bodies plus, quite possibly, its vendored `bignum`/`big_curve` dependencies
needing their own tag bumps. **`escrow_envelope`'s ICE is the only other open item** and is plausibly
an upstream compiler bug worth reducing and reporting.

**ALWAYS run `nargo test`, never `nargo compile`, to judge a circuit crate's health.** Compile
success on a crate with tests is close to meaningless - this run proves it.

**🚦 MIGRATION RUN 1 - GOT 6 OF 7 CIRCUITS COMPILING AND `pp` 87/87 GREEN ON beta.26, THEN
`verify-migration.sh` SAID **NOT VERIFIED** AND IT WAS REVERTED. The gate worked.**

How far it got, and the exact fixes (all mechanical once found - redo them, do not rediscover them):
1. `poseidon` v0.2.0 -> **v0.3.0** and `nargo` -> **beta.26** TOGETHER (neither works alone).
2. Scripted `u1` -> `bool`: `[u1;`->`[bool;`, `: u1`->`: bool`, `-> u1`->`-> bool`, `) as u1`->`)`,
   `global X: bool = 0/1` -> `false/true`.
3. **Test-body comparisons**: `smt_verifier*(...) == 1/0` -> `== true/false`. Do this LINE-BASED - a
   regex using `[^;]*?` cannot cross the `;` inside `[0; 20]` and silently misses those call sites.
4. **`smt_verifier_full` positional args**: arg 6 `is_old0` and arg 7 `fnc` are now `bool`; args 4-5
   (`old_key`, `old_value`) stay **`Field`**. My first pass converted 4 and 5 too and broke both
   circuits - the arity boundary is the trap.
5. `assert(cleared == 1)` / `assert(active == 1)` -> `== true`.

**RESULT: `pp` 87/87 PASSED on beta.26** - so the SMT rewrite preserves behaviour for everything pp
covers, which is the strongest single signal we have. `ragequit`, `title_holder`, `withdraw_identity`
and `notary_action` all compile. **`escrow_envelope` still ICEs.** And `verify-migration.sh` reported
coverage loss in **`noir_dl_lib`** (e.g. `smt::test_rejects_wrong_value`) -> **NOT VERIFIED**.

**WHY IT WAS REVERTED RATHER THAN "FIXED UP":** the whole point of the gate is that it is not
negotiable. `noir_dl_lib` has its own `smt.nr`/`utils.nr` with the same `u1` patterns, and its tests
were not fully carried across. Landing a partially-verified rewrite of SMT code is the silent-fork
risk this file warns about throughout. **Reverted; beta.13 + poseidon v0.2.0, all seven circuits
compile.**

**NEXT ATTEMPT - it is now a SHORT job:** redo steps 1-5 (they are known-good), then apply the SAME
test-body fixes to `noir_dl_lib/src/smt.nr` and `utils.nr`, run `./verify-migration.sh`, and require
`RESULT: no coverage lost`. The remaining unknown is only the `escrow_envelope` ICE, which may be a
genuine upstream bug worth reducing and reporting.

**📋 THE MIGRATION ORACLE IS COMPLETE AND COMMITTED: `backend/circuits/MIGRATION-BASELINE.txt`.**
Captured on beta.13 + poseidon v0.2.0 BEFORE any change, which is the only moment it is capturable.

- **`pp` roster: 87 test names.** **`noir_dl_lib` roster: 80 test names** - and note **this file and
  sec. 2.3 both said 49. The real number is 80.** Had "49 passing" been the acceptance criterion, a
  migration that silently dropped **31 tests** would have passed it. *That is the entire argument for
  a roster over a count*, demonstrated on our own stale documentation.
- **SHA-256 of all 128 circuit source files.** This REPLACED an earlier list of 96 scraped constants:
  checking that scrape found it had missed **1,530 shorter hex constants and 20-digit decimals**,
  because it selected literals by LENGTH. A length threshold cannot prove it caught everything, and a
  migration altering a constant it skipped would pass a gate built on it. Checksums cannot miss
  anything. They are not pass/fail - the `u1` rewrite legitimately changes most files - they are the
  exhaustive CHANGE LIST naming which files need a line-by-line constant diff against git.

**HOW TO USE IT.** After migrating: (1) every test name in both rosters must still RUN and PASS -
a renamed or skipped test passes by not running; (2) for every file whose checksum changed, diff its
numeric literals against git and confirm only the `u1`/`bool` types moved; (3) the published
`sk_identity = 1234 -> holder_root` vectors must be byte-identical. All three, or the migration is
not verified.

**🔧 MIGRATION ATTEMPTED 2026-08-01 - GOT PART-WAY, REVERTED. Exact stopping point recorded so the
next attempt starts here rather than at the beginning.**

Applied together: `poseidon` v0.2.0 -> **v0.3.0**, `nargo` beta.13 -> **beta.26**, and a scripted
`u1` -> `bool` rewrite across 15 files (`[u1;` -> `[bool;`, `: u1` -> `: bool`, `-> u1` -> `-> bool`,
`) as u1` -> `)`, `global X: bool = 0/1` -> `false/true`).

**RESULT:**
- ✅ **`pp` and `noir_dl_lib` COMPILE** on beta.26 - the library layer migrates cleanly. The scripted
  rewrite is CORRECT as far as the compiler is concerned for the library sources.
- ❌ **`pp`'s own TESTS do not compile: 40 errors.** The rewrite covered `src/` but the test bodies
  use the same `u1` patterns and were not all reached. **This is where the next attempt starts.**
- ❌ `noir_dl_lib` tests hit a **compiler ICE** ("This is a bug... consider opening one").
- ❌ The 4 dependent circuits fail with `Types in a binary operation should match, but found bool` -
  callers comparing a now-`bool` result against an integer. Mechanical, but only worth doing after
  the tests pass.
- ❌ `escrow_envelope` still ICEs at compile.

**WHY IT WAS REVERTED RATHER THAN PUSHED THROUGH: the tests are the ONLY thing that can prove the
`u1` -> `bool` rewrite preserved SMT behaviour**, and they did not run. Landing an unverified rewrite
of `pp/src/smt.nr` - the verifier every identity and title commitment depends on - would be exactly
the silent fork this file warns about everywhere else. A compiling circuit proves nothing here.
**Reverted; beta.13 + poseidon v0.2.0 restored, all seven circuits compile, `pp` 87/87 tests pass.**

**NEXT ATTEMPT, starting from the known stopping point:** (1) redo the scripted rewrite but include
`#[test]` bodies - the 40 `pp` errors are the checklist; (2) get `pp` 87/87 and `noir_dl_lib` green,
**and confirm the published `sk_identity = 1234 -> holder_root` vectors are byte-identical** - that is
the acceptance criterion, not compilation; (3) fix the 4 callers; (4) the two ICEs (`escrow_envelope`
compile, `noir_dl_lib` test) may be genuine upstream bugs - reduce and report if they persist.

**🗺️ THE beta.26 MIGRATION IS ACHIEVABLE - FULL BLOCKER MAP, MEASURED 2026-08-01.** It is not a
version bump and it is not blocked; it is a bounded, well-understood piece of work. **Everything
below was tested; the repo was restored to beta.13 + poseidon v0.2.0 afterwards and all six circuits
rebuild green.**

| step | status on beta.26 |
|---|---|
| `poseidon` **v0.2.0** (our pin) | ❌ `Comptime global RATE used in non-comptime code` |
| **`poseidon` v0.3.0** (latest) | ✅ **`pp` and `noir_dl_lib` COMPILE** - this is the fix for that error |
| poseidon v0.3.0 on **beta.13** | ❌ `Expected an expression but found '@'` - the two upgrades are ATOMIC, neither works alone |
| `withdraw_identity`, `ragequit`, `title_holder`, `notary_action` | ❌ **`u1` has been removed, use `bool`** - OUR source, 51 sites |
| `escrow_envelope` | ❌ **compiler ICE** (panics) - the only genuinely unknown item |

**THE `u1` -> `bool` MIGRATION IS THE REAL WORK, AND IT IS DANGEROUS - do not treat it as
search-and-replace.** 51 sites, concentrated in **`pp/src/smt.nr`**, which is the SMT verifier every
identity and title commitment depends on. `u1` is an INTEGER used arithmetically; `bool` is not:
- `(levels[0] == root) as u1` -> the cast disappears
- `switcher(l, r, bit: u1)` and any `1 - bit` arithmetic must be rewritten as boolean logic
- `key.to_le_bits()` returns `[u1; 254]` on beta.13 and `[bool; 254]` on beta.26

A wrong rewrite here does not fail loudly - it silently changes SMT results and forks every
commitment in the system. **Acceptance: `pp`'s 53 tests and `noir_dl_lib`'s 49 must pass unchanged,
AND the published vectors (`sk_identity = 1234 -> holder_root` in `identity_asp.nr` /
`title_holder.nr`) must be byte-identical.** Those vectors exist precisely for this; they are the
only thing that can prove the rewrite preserved behaviour.

**WHY THIS IS WORTH DOING** (the user asked, 2026-08-01): recursion - and therefore the whole
aggregation gas win - **only works on beta.26 + bb 5.x**, proven by the soundness harness below.
beta.13 + bb 1.2.0 silently accepts unsound recursive circuits. So this migration is the gate on
sec. 2.4 entirely, and it likely brings unrelated fixes across 13 releases.

**ORDER:** (1) upgrade poseidon to v0.3.0 AND nargo to beta.26 together; (2) do the `u1` -> `bool`
rewrite, checking the published vectors after; (3) diagnose the `escrow_envelope` ICE - it is the
only unknown, and may be a genuine upstream bug worth reporting; (4) regenerate all verifiers with
`-t evm` (replaces `--oracle_hash keccak`) and re-check `forge build --sizes`, since the withdrawal
verifier has ~85 bytes of EIP-170 margin and 5.x codegen may differ; (5) rebuild the aggregator with
`proof_type = 6` and the 115/458 field sizes, and re-run the soundness harness.

**🔬 SOUNDNESS HARNESS RUN 2026-08-01 - RECURSION GENUINELY BINDS. Five cases, no false positive or
negative left standing:**

| case | inner proof supplied | result | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ok** | valid proof of the stated fact | **ACCEPTED** | no false NEGATIVE - honest work is not rejected |
| **swap** | **valid, well-formed proof of a DIFFERENT statement** | **REFUSED at verify** | **THE GOLD STANDARD. The proof is bound to ITS public inputs.** |
| **corrupt** | real proof, one field incremented | REFUSED at prove | tampering caught |
| **zero** | all-zero (malformed) | REFUSED at prove | malformed caught |
| ~~wrongvk~~ | *(invalid test - see below)* | - | proves nothing |

**`swap` is the case that matters and it PASSES.** Both the proof and the public inputs are
individually valid and well-formed; only their CORRESPONDENCE is wrong, and it is rejected. That is
real soundness, not a parser refusing malformed bytes - which is all the earlier all-zero test showed.
**On bb 1.2.0 every one of these was ACCEPTED.**

⚠️ **ONE OF MY OWN TEST CASES WAS INVALID, and it initially read as a soundness hole.** `wrongvk`
passed circuit B's key with circuit A's proof and was ACCEPTED - alarming until checked: A and B are
**the same circuit** with different witnesses, so `write_vk` emits a BYTE-IDENTICAL key
(`cmp tA/vk tB/vk` -> identical). It was never a wrong key. **A wrong-VK test needs a genuinely
DIFFERENT circuit** and is still OUTSTANDING - it is the property the aggregator's pinned
`WITHDRAW_IDENTITY_VK` depends on (sec. 2.4 constraint 1), so write it before shipping: compile a
second, different inner circuit, and confirm its proof is REFUSED against the pinned key.

**THE HARNESS IS THE DELIVERABLE. Commit it** (`scratchpad/rmin`: inner, outer, and the five
`Prover.*.toml`) and run it after ANY change to a recursive circuit or the toolchain. Reading it:
`ok` ACCEPTED and `swap` REFUSED together are the pass condition. Either alone is worthless - `ok`
alone cannot distinguish a sound circuit from one that accepts everything, and `swap` alone cannot
distinguish soundness from a broken build.

**✅✅✅ RECURSION BINDS. PROVEN 2026-08-01 on `nargo` v1.0.0-beta.26 + `bb` 5.1.0.**

Minimal pair, `proof_type = 6` (`PROOF_TYPE_HONK_ZK`), 458-field ZK inner proof, real `vk_hash`:

| witness | result |
|---|---|
| REAL inner proof | **verifies** |
| ALL-ZERO inner proof | **REFUSED AT PROVE** - `serialize_to_fields: bn254_commitment point at infinity must be canonical (0,0)` |

Same command, same key, opposite outcomes. **On bb 1.2.0 that identical garbage witness proved AND
verified.** The failure is a cryptographic assertion inside the recursive verifier, not a CLI error -
the trap that made bb 0.87.0 look like a fix earlier.

**THE WORKING RECIPE:**
- `nargo` **v1.0.0-beta.26**, `bb` **5.1.0**
- INNER: `bb write_vk -b c.json -o target -t noir-recursive` then
  `bb prove -b c.json -w w.gz -k target/vk -o target -t noir-recursive`
  -> vk **115** fields, proof **458** fields, plus a **`vk_hash`** file - pass that as `key_hash`,
  not 0
- CIRCUIT: `std::verify_proof_with_type(vk, proof, public_inputs, key_hash, **6**)`
  with `[Field; 115]` and `[Field; 458]`
- OUTER: `-t evm` (keccak, ZK) for the on-chain proof

**WHY EVERY EARLIER ATTEMPT FAILED:** `proof_type = 0` is `PROOF_TYPE_HONK`, which expects a **NON-ZK**
410-field proof; we were feeding it the **ZK** 458-field one. bb 1.2.0 accepted the mismatch silently
and produced a circuit that constrained nothing. bb 5.x reports it
(`ACIR proof size mismatch. Expected: 410`). The lengths, `proof_type` and ZK-ness are ONE coupled
choice - pick `6` + ZK + 458, or `0` + non-ZK + 410, never a mix.

**⚠️ ONE HONEST LIMIT ON THIS EVIDENCE.** An all-zero proof is MALFORMED (invalid curve points), so it
is rejected during parsing. That proves the recursive verifier now genuinely processes the proof -
which bb 1.2.0 demonstrably did not - but the STRONGEST negative test is a WELL-FORMED but WRONG
proof: take the real proof and corrupt one field, or use a valid proof from a DIFFERENT circuit.
**Run that before trusting aggregation with money.** It is a five-minute test on the `rmin` harness.

**MIGRATION IS NOW JUSTIFIED (user: *"if the latest version is the only one that works we should use
that across all our uses"*)** - and it is a real migration, not a bump. `codegen-verifiers.sh` pins
beta.13 + 1.2.0 precisely because neighbours fail SILENTLY. Sequence: (1) run the well-formed-wrong
test above; (2) recompile all five standalone circuits on beta.26 and re-run ALL THREE of that
script's checks each - native verify, prover non-determinism/ZK, and a real proof accepted on-chain
by forge; (3) regenerate every verifier (`-t evm` replaces `--oracle_hash keccak`) and re-check
`forge build --sizes` against EIP-170, since the withdrawal verifier has ~85 bytes of margin and the
5.x codegen may differ; (4) only then rebuild the aggregator, re-verify the keccak fold with the
garbage test, and regenerate `AggregationHonkVerifier`.

**🎯 ROOT CAUSE FOUND 2026-08-01 - A ZK/NON-ZK MISMATCH. bb 5.x SAYS IT OUT LOUD.**
On `nargo` beta.26 + `bb` 5.1.0 the outer circuit fails with a REAL diagnostic, the first one this
investigation has produced:

> `create_honk_recursion_constraints: ACIR proof size mismatch. Expected: 410`

**410 is Aztec's `RECURSIVE_PROOF_LENGTH` (NON-ZK). 458 is `RECURSIVE_ZK_PROOF_LENGTH` (ZK).** And
the proof_type constants split the same way: **`PROOF_TYPE_HONK = 0` expects a NON-ZK inner proof;
`PROOF_TYPE_HONK_ZK = 6` expects the ZK one.** We have been feeding a **ZK** inner proof to
`proof_type = 0`. The in-circuit verifier was being handed a proof of the wrong shape all along -
which is exactly the kind of thing bb 1.2.0 accepted silently and bb 5.x refuses with a message.

**bb 5.x + beta.26 also produces artifacts that MATCH the published library constants**, which
bb 1.2.0 never did: vk = **115** fields (`ULTRA_VK_LENGTH_IN_FIELDS = 115`, ours was 112), proof =
**458** ZK / **410** non-ZK. It also emits a **`vk_hash` file** - the `key_hash` argument we were
passing as 0 and guessing at. Three independent numbers agreeing with the documentation is strong
evidence this is the intended pairing.

**THE TWO CANDIDATE FIXES, to try in this order on beta.26 + bb 5.x:**
1. **`proof_type = 6` (`PROOF_TYPE_HONK_ZK`) with the 458-field ZK proof.** PREFERRED - it keeps the
   inner proof zero-knowledge. (On beta.13 `6` failed to build; that may simply be its age.)
2. `proof_type = 0` with a **non-ZK** inner proof (`-t noir-recursive-no-zk`, 410 fields).
   ⚠️ **A non-ZK inner proof LEAKS THE WITNESS to the batcher** - `nullifier`, `secret`, `label`,
   `value`, `sk_identity`. That destroys exactly the unlinkability the pool exists for. **Only
   acceptable if the inner proof never leaves the user's device, which it does not in this design.**
   Treat as a fallback and document loudly if taken.

Also pass the real `vk_hash` (bb 5.x writes it) rather than 0, and re-check `public_inputs` for
1 + 16.

**bb 5.x CLI, for whoever continues:** no `--scheme` / `--oracle_hash` / `--honk_recursion`. Use
`-t/--verifier_target`: **`noir-recursive`** (poseidon2, ZK) or `noir-recursive-no-zk` for INNER
proofs, **`evm`** (keccak, ZK) for the outer/on-chain proof. `--output_format json` emits a vk.json
carrying `bb_version`/`scheme` metadata, but `prove -k` needs the BINARY vk.

⚠️ **beta.13 was restored again** after this test (`noirup` overwrites in place).

**✅ THE DIAGNOSIS IS NOW COMPLETE AND PRECISE (2026-08-01). The accumulator cannot be propagated on
beta.13 + bb 1.2.0 BY EITHER OF THE TWO MECHANISMS THAT EXIST. Nothing else is wrong.**

There are exactly two ways a pairing-point accumulator can leave a circuit, and both were tested:

1. **The CIRCUIT returns it.** Probed directly: `let acc: u8 = std::verify_proof_with_type(...)` gives
   `error: Expected type u8, found type ()`. **The function returns UNIT on beta.13** - there is no
   value to return from `main`, so this route does not exist in the language here.
2. **The BACKEND adds it**, which is what `--honk_recursion` is for ("Ensures a pairing point
   accumulator is added to the public inputs", per bb's own `--help`). On bb 1.2.0 that flag on the
   OUTER proof **writes no vk at all**, under every transcript and with/without
   `--init_kzg_accumulator`.

So the outer proof's `public_inputs` stays at **1 field** instead of 1 + 16, the deferred pairing
check never runs, and any inner proof - real or all-zero - satisfies what remains. **That is the whole
bug.** It is not the fold, not `proof_type` (0 is correct), not the pinned key, not the circuit logic,
and not something we wrote.

**HOW TO READ THE OUTPUTS - the three that misled me, so they are not misread again:**
- **`bb verify` says "Proof verified successfully" AND exits 0 on failure.** Success here means "the
  outer proof is valid for this circuit", which is TRUE even when the circuit constrains nothing.
  **It is not evidence that inner proofs were checked.** Only a REJECTED garbage batch is.
- **`nargo execute` succeeding is meaningless for recursion** - the opcode is discharged as a black
  box and never validates its inputs. It solved happily for all-zero proofs at every stage.
- **`public_inputs` field count is the real instrument.** 1 = no accumulator = deferred check absent.
  1 + 16 = accumulator carried. **Check this number first in any future attempt**; it would have
  found the bug in minutes rather than hours, and it is the one output that never lied.

**THE FIX IS A TOOLCHAIN WITH A WORKING `--honk_recursion` (or an API returning the accumulator).**
`nargo` v1.0.0-beta.26 compiles both minimal circuits unchanged, so the source needs no edit; the
work is driving it with a matching `bb` 5.x, whose CLI differs entirely (`--verifier_target`,
`--output_format`; no `--scheme`/`--oracle_hash`/`--honk_recursion`). **Acceptance, in order:**
(1) outer `public_inputs` == 1 + 16; (2) the real proof verifies; (3) the all-zero proof is REFUSED.
All three, or it is not fixed.

**🔑 THE HIDDEN ASSUMPTION IN MY OWN TEST, FOUND 2026-08-01 (user: *"maybe the way you are testing it
is the issue"*). This reframes everything above and is the most useful thing in this section.**

I assumed a garbage inner proof must fail INSIDE the circuit. **Honk recursion does not work that
way.** The in-circuit verifier performs Fiat-Shamir and sumcheck, then **DEFERS the expensive final
pairing check into a PAIRING-POINT ACCUMULATOR**, which must be carried out of the circuit as public
inputs and checked by whoever verifies the OUTER proof.

**So "garbage accepted" does NOT prove the constraints are missing.** It is equally consistent with
the constraints being fine and the ACCUMULATOR NEVER BEING PROPAGATED - in which case the deferred
check simply never runs. And the accumulator is exactly what has been missing all along: **the outer
proof's `public_inputs` is 1 field under EVERY flag combination tried** (`--honk_recursion 1`,
`--honk_recursion 2`, `--init_kzg_accumulator`, both transcripts, alone and combined), never the
1 + 16 that a propagated accumulator would give. Every combination that might add it writes **no vk
at all** on bb 1.2.0.

**Therefore the correct diagnosis is narrower and more hopeful than "recursion is broken":** we have
never succeeded in getting bb 1.2.0 to EMIT a circuit that carries its pairing-point accumulator. The
in-circuit constraints may well be correct. **The thing to fix is accumulator propagation, not the
circuit.** Note this also explains the 550,404-gate keccak result differently: with no accumulator to
constrain, the optimiser has even more freedom to drop work.

**LATEST TOOLCHAIN TRIED, AND WHY IT STOPPED (2026-08-01).** `nargo` v1.0.0-beta.26 (latest,
2026-07-30) installed via `noirup`; the minimal inner AND outer circuits **both compile unchanged**,
so the recursion API is still `std::verify_proof_with_type`. The blocker is `bb`: the 5.x line has a
**completely different CLI** - no `--scheme`, no `--oracle_hash`, no `--honk_recursion`; instead
`-b/--bytecode_path`, `-o/--output_path`, `--verifier_target`, `--output_format`. So beta.26 needs a
matching bb driven the 5.x way, which is the next session's first task and is NOT a large job:
recompile the minimal pair, generate inner artifacts with the 5.x syntax, rebuild the outer for
whatever vk/proof LENGTHS 5.x reports (they will differ from 112/507), then run the real-vs-garbage
pair. **Check `public_inputs` for 1 + 16 fields - that single number tells you immediately whether
the accumulator is finally being carried.**

⚠️ **The pinned `nargo` beta.13 was RESTORED** (`noirup` overwrites `~/.nargo/bin/nargo` in place; it
was backed up first and `withdraw_identity` re-verified as building afterwards). Anyone repeating this
MUST back up and restore, or every pinned circuit in the repo silently changes compiler.

**EVERY INSTALLED bb TESTED 2026-08-01 - NONE BINDS RECURSION.** Six are on this machine; the
minimal pair was run against all of them with an ALL-ZERO inner proof:

| bb | result on beta.13 artifacts |
|---|---|
| 0.82.2 | writes no vk |
| **0.87.0** | **crashes: "Trying to invert zero in the field"** - cannot consume beta.13 artifacts |
| 1.0.0 | **garbage ACCEPTED** |
| **1.2.0 (our pin)** | **garbage ACCEPTED** |
| 5.0.0 | writes no vk |
| 5.1.0 | writes no vk |

⚠️ **A NEAR-MISS WORTH RECORDING: 0.87.0 first appeared to REJECT the garbage** ("no proof produced"),
which looked like the breakthrough. It was a **CLI error** - `-k` is not accepted on `prove` before
bb 1.x (`codegen-verifiers.sh` records exactly this), so the command never ran. Re-run with that
version's own syntax and it crashes on both real and garbage alike. **Any future "version X rejects
garbage" claim must be checked for this**: a tool that fails to RUN looks identical to a constraint
that fires, and only the real-proof control distinguishes them. Always test BOTH witnesses.

**THE CONCRETE PATH OUT, in order:**
1. **`nargo` beta.13 is 13 releases behind - latest is v1.0.0-beta.26 (2026-07-30)** and `noirup` is
   installed at `~/.nargo/bin/noirup`. Install a recent beta into a SEPARATE toolchain and run the
   minimal pair against it with its matching `bb`. Recursion is heavily used by Aztec, so a working
   pair certainly exists; ours simply predates the fix or misses a required flag.
2. Only if that works, plan the migration - and note it is a REAL migration, not a bump:
   `codegen-verifiers.sh` pins beta.13 + 1.2.0 because neighbouring versions fail SILENTLY for the
   five standalone circuits (beta.1 emits proofs bb's own verifier rejects; beta.22+ ICEs on
   `query_identity`/`register_identity`). All three of that script's checks must pass for every
   circuit before the pin moves.
3. The `rmin` harness in the scratchpad is the acceptance test and should be committed somewhere
   durable: inner circuit, outer circuit, and BOTH witnesses (`Prover.real.toml`, `Prover.junk.toml`).
   Pass = real verifies AND garbage is refused. It is small, fast, and it is the only thing that has
   reliably told the truth in this investigation.

**THE ONE ACTION: get the working recursion toolchain.** The user reported (2026-08-01) having sorted
recursion on another machine - obtain its exact `nargo` and `bb` versions and its verified
invocation. **The acceptance test is fixed and non-negotiable: the minimal pair must REJECT an
all-zero inner proof.** "A real proof verifies" proves nothing and must never again be accepted as
evidence. Then re-validate the pinned toolchain guard in `codegen-verifiers.sh`, since a bump has to
keep all five existing standalone circuits sound.

**🔴🔴🔴 RECURSION HAS NEVER WORKED IN ANY VERSION. THE keccak CHANGE DID NOT BREAK IT (2026-08-01).**
Tested both circuits with ALL-ZERO inner proofs and REAL public inputs:

| circuit | N=2 gates | garbage batch |
|---|---|---|
| Poseidon fold, `proof_type = 0` (the "working" version) | 1,396,874 | **ACCEPTED** |
| keccak fold | 81,668 | **ACCEPTED** |

**So my earlier claim - "bb verify accepts an aggregation of two REAL withdraw_identity proofs, the
aggregator works" - was MEANINGLESS.** It verified because the circuit accepts anything. Two real
proofs are not evidence when garbage passes too, and I never ran the negative case before declaring
success. Retract that claim wherever it is relied on.

The two circuits are broken DIFFERENTLY, which is itself a clue:
- **Poseidon version:** the ~725k gates per verification ARE present (1.4M at N=2) but are VACUOUS -
  satisfied by any proof. Constraints emitted, nothing bound.
- **keccak version:** the constraints are absent entirely (81,668 gates).

So the `proof_type = 0` fix made proofs VERIFY without making recursion SOUND - it moved the failure
from "cannot prove" to "proves anything", which looks like success at every stage.

**WHAT THIS MEANS FOR sec. 2.4.** The aggregator is NOT partially built - its central security
property has never held. Everything else stands (the pinned key, the range checks, the fold, the
N=16 verifier at 84 bytes under EIP-170, the gas analysis), but none of it matters until
`verify_proof_with_type` actually binds. **Treat the aggregator as UNBUILT for planning purposes.**

**NEXT, and nothing else until this passes:** get a MINIMAL recursion pair to REJECT a garbage inner
proof - the `rmin` pair from earlier is the right harness, and the acceptance criterion is
"`bb verify` FAILS on garbage", never "`bb verify` succeeds on a real proof". Only then does the
question of which fold to use matter again. Likely suspects: bb needs a flag for the OUTER proof to
enforce recursion constraints (`--honk_recursion` on the outer failed to write a vk with keccak -
that combination may be exactly what is required and may need a different transcript), or beta.13 +
bb 1.2.0 emits the opcode without wiring it - which would resurrect the toolchain question that was
prematurely dismissed when `proof_type` appeared to explain everything.

**🔴🔴 CONFIRMED 2026-08-01: THE CIRCUIT NO LONGER VERIFIES ITS INNER PROOFS. A BATCH OF ALL-ZERO
GARBAGE PROOFS PROVES AND `bb verify` ACCEPTS IT.** This is not a gate-accounting curiosity - the
constraints are genuinely absent, and as written the aggregator would accept ANY claimed withdrawal.
`src/main.nr` now carries a blocking banner. **Do not build the batch entrypoint and do not deploy
`AggregationHonkVerifier` until a garbage batch is REJECTED.**

Evidence, all reproducible:
- N=2 keccak circuit: **81,668 gates**. The identical circuit with the Poseidon fold: **1,396,874**.
  Two in-circuit UltraHonk verifications are ~725k gates each - they are simply not present.
- N=16: 550,404 gates vs 11,610,552 before; artifact halved; `acir_opcodes` ROSE 13,211 -> 55,811.
  Opcodes up while circuit_size collapses = not a failed compile.
- `nargo execute` accepts the garbage witness, `bb prove` writes a proof, `bb verify` says
  "Proof verified successfully". Every stage reports success, exactly as with the `proof_type` bug.

**THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WORKING AND BROKEN is the fold (Poseidon -> keccak256) plus its
Nargo.toml dependency swap.** Bisect that: (1) keep the keccak dependency but restore the Poseidon
fold body - if recursion returns, the DEPENDENCY is implicated; (2) keep the Poseidon dependency but
inline a trivial keccak - if recursion vanishes, the keccak INTRINSIC is. A plausible mechanism is
dead-code elimination: `verify_proof_with_type` returns nothing, so if the optimiser concludes the
`proofs` parameter cannot affect the public output it may drop the whole thing - and the keccak fold
changed what the optimiser can see about `public_inputs`.

**THE GENERAL LESSON, worth more than this bug:** a gate count is a SAFETY SIGNAL for a recursive
circuit, not a performance statistic. The 5 unit tests still pass, the fold is correct, the witness
solves, the proof verifies - and the circuit is worthless. **Every future change to a recursive
circuit must re-run the garbage-proof test**, because nothing else here distinguishes "verifies N
proofs" from "verifies nothing".

**⚠️ KECCAK FOLD APPLIED TO THE CIRCUIT 2026-08-01 - AND IT PRODUCED AN UNEXPLAINED ANOMALY. DO NOT
TREAT IT AS WORKING.** The 5 circuit tests still pass and the fold logic is right, but the falsifiable
prediction FAILED:

| | before (Poseidon fold) | predicted | **actual** |
|---|---|---|---|
| circuit_size | 11,610,552 | ~12.16M | **550,404** |
| acir_opcodes | 13,211 | - | **55,811** |
| artifact | 2,285,971 B | - | **1,041,969 B** |

550,404 is almost exactly the keccak fold measured ALONE (550,220). **The 16 recursive verifications
have disappeared from the circuit**, even though `main` still calls `std::verify_proof_with_type` at
`src/main.nr:145` and a clean `rm -rf target && nargo compile` reproduces it. ACIR opcodes went UP
(keccak adds many) while circuit_size collapsed - so this is not a failed compile, it is bb no longer
expanding the recursion constraints.

**A circuit that silently stops verifying its inner proofs is the single worst failure available
here** - it would aggregate anything. This MUST be understood before the contract side is touched.
Hypotheses, none tested: the dependency swap (`poseidon` -> `keccak256`) changed something about how
the recursion opcode is emitted; `bb gates` needs a flag to expand recursion that the larger circuit
previously triggered incidentally; or the keccak intrinsic interacts with the recursion opcode's
handling. **The decisive test is cheap and already built: re-run the N=2 end-to-end
(witness -> prove -> `bb verify`) from sec. 2.4a. If a proof still verifies against two REAL
withdraw_identity proofs, the recursion is intact and only the GATE ACCOUNTING changed; if it now
verifies with GARBAGE inner proofs, the constraints are genuinely gone.** Run that before anything else.

**The contract side was deliberately NOT changed** - `BatchCommitmentLib` is still Poseidon, so the
circuit and contract now DISAGREE and `BatchCommitmentTest`'s fixture is stale by design. Do not
"fix" that test until the anomaly above is resolved; it is currently the correct state of a
half-applied change.

**THE CHANGE TO MAKE** (contract half not yet applied - do it as the ONE money-path change in its run):
- `aggregate_withdrawals`: replace `fold_signals`/`batch_commitment` with a single keccak over the N x 7
  signals serialised big-endian, exactly as `abi.encodePacked` lays them out, and expose the digest.
  Mind the field/`bytes32` boundary - the public input is a `Field`, so the digest must be reduced
  (`% SNARK_SCALAR_FIELD`) the same way `context` already is in `withdraw_identity`.
- `BatchCommitmentLib`: replace the PoseidonT6/T5 chain with `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(signals))`,
  reduced identically. Keep every existing test - order-binding, per-signal binding, length-binding
  and the empty batch all still apply, and the circuit-emitted fixture must be regenerated.
- The Poseidon inline libraries stay: they are correct, tested, and worth their ~11% everywhere ELSE
  in the repo (SMT paths), which is a separate concern from the fold.

**Superseded - the Poseidon-inlining investigation, kept so the dead ends are not re-run:**

**✅ SOLVED, AND THE ANSWER IS NOT INLINING (2026-08-01). MEASURED, not inferred:**

| | gas |
|---|---|
| `PoseidonT3.hash` **public** (DELEGATECALL) | **32,489** |
| `PoseidonT3Inline.hash` **internal** (inlined) | **29,058** |
| **saving** | **~3,400 (~11%)** |

**MY EARLIER "~11x" WAS WRONG - it was a bad subtraction, not a measurement.** I took a 61,730-gas
total, subtracted one 32,549 public hash, and attributed the remainder to THREE inline hashes. The
total was in fact TWO hashes (32,549 + 29,058 = 61,607). Nothing was ever 11x.

**SO THE DELEGATECALL IS ONLY ~3,400 GAS; THE OTHER ~29,000 IS POSEIDON'S OWN ARITHMETIC.** This
implementation is inherently expensive - the ~1,283 gas the upstream README advertises cannot refer
to this code path. Inlining is a real but MARGINAL win, and no amount of call-boundary engineering
reaches the numbers this repo needs. Routes (a)-(d) all optimise the wrong term.

**CONSEQUENCE 1 - THE AGGREGATION FOLD MUST USE KECCAK (sec. 2.4a).** Inlining takes it from 287,969
to roughly 256,000 gas/withdrawal, still far past the 152,846 target for the WHOLE withdrawal. keccak
is a few thousand gas on-chain for ~34% more circuit gates (11.6M -> ~15.6M, ~27 GB -> ~36 GB proving).
That is now clearly correct, and the earlier "keep Poseidon" conclusion is retracted.

**CONSEQUENCE 2 - THE SMT COST IS STRUCTURAL, not a wrapper problem.** An SMT insert at depth 4
measured 144,423 gas both before AND after the migration (identical to the gas unit), because the
saving is ~3.4k per hash against ~29k of unavoidable arithmetic. Making SMT operations genuinely
cheap needs a different Poseidon implementation or fewer hashes, not better plumbing.

**WHAT LANDED AND IS WORTH KEEPING.** `contracts/libraries/inline/PoseidonT{2..6}Inline.sol` are
correct and proven: they take the ~11%, all 405 forge tests pass with `Poseidon.sol` routed through
them, and `PoseidonInlineDifferentialTest` (9 tests, 512 fuzz runs) pins every arity against upstream
**from callers with PRE-ALLOCATED MEMORY**, plus clobber checks that the saved bytes at 0x80 are
restored. That last part is the fix for the bug that broke attempt 1.

**THE TRANSFORM THAT MAKES INLINING SAFE** (three edits, all mechanical, `tools/gen-inline-poseidon.sh`):
`public`->`internal`; **save/copy/restore the words at 0x80..** around the otherwise-UNTOUCHED assembly
(the upstream code reads inputs from hardcoded 0x80/0xa0/... and its Yul round functions cannot see
Solidity locals, so relocating the reads is impossible - copying to where it looks is); and replace the
raw `return(0, 0x20)`, which would otherwise HALT THE CALLER, with a named return variable.

**Superseded investigation, kept so the dead ends are not re-run:**

**ATTEMPT 2 (2026-08-01) — THE EXACT EDITS ARE NOW KNOWN, AND SO IS WHAT BLOCKS THEM.** Making the
library inlinable needs THREE changes, not one, and the two I missed are the reason attempt 1 broke
31 tests:

1. `public` -> `internal` (the gas win).
2. **Inputs are read from HARDCODED addresses** - `mload(0x80)`, `mload(0xa0)`, `mload(0xc0)`,
   `mload(0xe0)`, `mload(0x100)`. Those are where the ABI decoder places arguments **for an external
   call**. Inlined, they must read the parameter's own memory (`mload(inp)`, `mload(add(inp, 0x20))`,
   ...). Omitting this hashes whatever sits at 0x80 - silently.
3. **The result is returned with the raw EVM `return(0, 0x20)`, which HALTS THE WHOLE CALL CONTEXT.**
   Inlined, that returns from the CALLER. It must assign a named return variable instead.

Applying all three to T2-T5 mechanically WORKS as a transform, but the build then fails:

> `Error (6578): Cannot access local Solidity variables from inside an inline assembly function.`

**THE BLOCKER: the assembly defines its own assembly-level FUNCTIONS** (`function pRound(...)`,
`function fRound(...)` - 3 of them in T6, at `PoseidonT6.sol:62,117`). Yul functions cannot close over
Solidity locals, so `inp` and `result` are unreachable from inside them, and T6's result is produced
inside that machinery rather than by a single `mstore(0x0, ...)` (which is also why the balanced-paren
rewrite found no `mstore(0x0,` in T6 at all). **The larger arities are structurally harder than the
small ones**, and T5/T6 are exactly the ones the aggregation fold needs.

**VIABLE ROUTES, cheapest first - none yet attempted:**
- **(a) Pass the values as Yul function ARGUMENTS.** The round functions already take `c0..c5`; thread
  the loaded inputs through instead of having them read fixed memory. Mechanical but per-arity.
- **(b) Copy inputs to 0x80 first, inside the internal wrapper.** Preserves the assembly untouched, but
  0x80 is live memory once the caller has allocated - it would need save/restore around the call, and
  correctness then depends on nothing else holding a pointer into that range. Cheap to try, easy to
  get subtly wrong.
- **(c) Use an internal-first Poseidon implementation** (one written for `internal` use) and pin it
  against the current `public` one across all arities.
- **(d) Amortise instead of inlining:** one external call that performs a whole SMT path's worth of
  hashes, paying ONE call boundary instead of 32. Needs no change to audited crypto at all, and is
  the only route here that touches no arithmetic.

**WHATEVER IS TRIED, THE DIFFERENTIAL SUITE MUST CALL IT FROM A CALLER WITH PRE-ALLOCATED MEMORY.**
Testing in isolation puts the array at 0x80 by luck and certifies a broken library - that is how
attempt 1 passed 8 tests and 512 fuzz runs while being wrong.

**THE GAS PROBLEM IS STILL OPEN AND STILL LARGE** (32,549 per 2-input hash; a depth-32 SMT insert is
over 1M gas). Options, none yet measured:
1. **Rewrite the assembly** to read from the parameter's actual memory offset instead of `0x80`.
   That is a real change to audited crypto - it needs the differential suite REBUILT to call it from
   a caller with pre-allocated memory, which is the case that just failed.
2. **Use a Poseidon written for internal use** (e.g. an `internal`-first implementation) and pin it
   against the current one, since the whole repo's commitments depend on the exact function.
3. **Leave it.** The `public`/DELEGATECALL cost is at least CORRECT, and correctness here is worth
   more than gas: every circuit, the wallet and every SMT assume ONE Poseidon.

**FOR THE AGGREGATION FOLD SPECIFICALLY, this reopens the keccak question** (sec. 2.4a): with
Poseidon stuck at ~288k gas/withdrawal, a keccak fold (a few thousand gas on-chain, ~34% more circuit
gates) is again the leading option. It forks the hash in ONE place, which is a smaller blast radius
than modifying the Poseidon every commitment depends on. **Decide this before building the batch
entrypoint.**

**Superseded conclusion, kept so the error is not repeated:**
Identical maths, `public` -> `internal` (so the compiler inlines instead of DELEGATECALLing), via
sed'd copies in `contracts/libraries/inline/`:

| | public (today) | internal (inlined) |
|---|---|---|
| T3 + T5 + T6, one call each | **324,921** | **~29,000** |

**~11x cheaper**, and `PoseidonInlineGasTest::test_InlineMatchesPublic` confirms the inlined copy
returns the IDENTICAL hash - so nothing forks. That puts the aggregation fold at roughly **~25k
gas/withdrawal instead of 287,969**, which is comfortable against the 152k target and removes the
only reason to consider keccak. Keccak would have bought a smaller win while forking the hash the
circuit, the wallet, `pp/src/commitment.nr` and every SMT already agree on.

**THE REPO-WIDE WIN IS THE REAL PRIZE, and it is bigger than the aggregator.** Every Poseidon call in
`PoseidonSMT`, `StateKeeper`, `IdentityRegistry`, `HolderStateKeeper` and `TitleLedger` currently pays
the DELEGATECALL price. A depth-32 SMT insert is ~32 hashes: **over 1M gas today, ~90k inlined.**

> **BOTH HALVES OF THAT SENTENCE ARE WRONG - MEASURED 2026-08-04, see
> `test/libraries/PoseidonInlineGas.t.sol`.**
> 1. **It is already done.** `libraries/Poseidon.sol` imports the `*Inline` libraries, every
>    `PoseidonUnit*L` caller (including `PoseidonSMT._hash`) is already `internal`, and the per-arity
>    differential tests against upstream exist and pass. Nothing pays the DELEGATECALL today.

**NEXT (do this before the batch entrypoint):** the copies in `contracts/libraries/inline/` are a
MEASUREMENT ARTEFACT produced by `sed` from `lib/poseidon-solidity` - they are not a migration.
Decide deliberately how to land it: vendor the files properly (with provenance + a differential test
against the upstream `public` version for every arity, not just T3), or upstream/patch. **Do not ship
sed'd copies**, and do not migrate call sites until the differential test covers each arity, because
a Poseidon that is fast and subtly wrong silently forks every commitment in the system.

**Superseded — the keccak option, kept so the reasoning is not re-run:** (a few thousand gas
on-chain vs 4.6M, at ~34% more circuit gates) - but decide it AFTER measuring an `internal`/assembly
Poseidon, because that would also preserve the byte-identical match with `pp/src/commitment.nr` that
the circuit, the wallet and the SMT all already rely on. Superseded note: ~144k gas for a single PoseidonT6 hash is anomalously high -
`poseidon-solidity` advertises ~1.3k for T3. Confirm whether our build is hitting an unoptimised path
(the library is `public` in `Poseidon.sol` and may not be inlined, and `optimizer_runs = 1` is scoped
to the verifiers). If a properly-optimised T6 is ~5-8k, the fold drops to ~15k/withdrawal and
Poseidon stays viable - which would preserve the byte-identical match with `pp/src/commitment.nr`.
**Measure that before rewriting the circuit's fold.**

**Still not started:** the contract side. `PrivacyPool.withdraw` stays untouched (non-negotiable);
what is missing is the batch entrypoint that recomputes the commitment from calldata (constraint 4)
and checks each withdrawal's real signals. The fold was deliberately shaped so it CAN: Poseidon
**v1** via `bn254::hash_5` then `hash_4`, because `poseidon-solidity` implements v1 and tops out at
`PoseidonT6` = 5 inputs. Using Poseidon2 would have compiled, proved, and produced a commitment the
contract could never reproduce.

### 2.4c-impl THE BATCH ENTRYPOINT EXISTS (2026-08-01) - built, compiling, PARTLY tested

**`PrivacyPool.withdrawBatch(Withdrawal[], uint256[7][], bytes)`** settles N withdrawals against one
aggregation proof. Plus `lib/BatchVerifierLib.sol` (verification half) and `lib/BatchCommitmentLib.sol`
(the keccak fold, pinned to the circuit by a circuit-emitted fixture). **411 forge tests pass.**

**DESIGN POINTS THAT MUST NOT BE UNDONE:**
- **Every policy check `validWithdrawal` makes is repeated per withdrawal.** The batch proof shows
  only that N valid `withdraw_identity` proofs exist and that their signals hash to the verifier's one
  public input. Aggregation amortises the PROOF check; it must NEVER amortise the POLICY checks.
- **The context comparison in `withdrawBatch` is LOAD-BEARING**, unlike the identically-shaped one in
  `validWithdrawal` that is labelled DIAGNOSTIC ONLY. `withdraw` binds by SUBSTITUTING context into
  the verifier inputs; the aggregation verifier takes ONE input, so here the binding is: signals are
  folded into the committed value, so each set's context must equal the one derived from ITS
  withdrawal. **Deleting that loop by analogy lets a batcher redirect every payout.**
- **No `msg.sender == processooor` check**, deliberately - the submitter is the batcher, who is not
  the payee. Safe because the payout target comes from the PROVEN withdrawal.
- **The depth check is intentionally ABSENT** here: the aggregation circuit constrains it on the full
  field, which is stronger. The single path still needs its own.
- **Root memo:** each DISTINCT state/identity root is checked once, not per withdrawal
  (`_isKnownRoot` walks history; `isValidRoot` is an external call).

**🔴 UNTESTED, DO NOT DEPLOY ON THE CURRENT SUITE:**
1. **`withdrawBatch` itself is never called by any test** - all four revert paths unexercised.
2. **The happy path** needs a real N=16 proof (~27 GB) - impossible on a dev machine.
3. ~~**Double-spend ACROSS a batch** (two withdrawals sharing a nullifier) is unproven.~~
   ✅ **CLOSED 2026-08-02** by `test/pool/WithdrawBatchEntrypoint.t.sol` - both the within-batch case
   and the across-batches case, plus UnknownStateRoot and InvalidIdentityRoot inside the settlement
   loop. Mutation-verified: deleting `_spend`'s already-spent check fails both. Reaching settlement
   needed a deposit (for a real state root and funds) and `setActiveRoot` for the identity root.
   **Note what this implies: the settlement loop now runs end-to-end** - the across-batches test only
   works because the FIRST batch settles - though against a doubled verifier, so the cryptography is
   still unexercised and item 2 stands.
`test/pool/WithdrawBatchGuards.t.sol` pins only the commitment PROPERTIES the guards rest on.

### 2.4b Aggregation sizing, infra and UX — what N to pick and what it costs

**N=256 flat is INFEASIBLE; tree-structured recursion makes it cheap.** Proving memory measured at
**3.4 KB/gate** (bb reported ~148 MiB for our 44,176-gate circuit), and in-circuit UltraHonk
verification is order 1M gates each:

| N | flat aggregator | RAM |
|---|---|---|
| 16 | 16M gates | ~56 GB |
| 64 | 64M gates | ~225 GB |
| 256 | 256M gates | **~899 GB — not a single machine** |

**Use a 16-wide TREE instead of one flat circuit.** Each node aggregates 16 proofs (~56 GB), and
depth 2 reaches N=256, depth 3 reaches N=4096 — every node stays at ~56 GB regardless of total N.
More proofs overall, but each is bounded and they parallelise across machines.

**Gas per withdrawal** (measured base 2.38M + 4,096 calldata that cannot be amortised, since the
contract needs each withdrawal's public inputs to recompute the batch commitment):

| N | gas | @30 gwei / $3k |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (today) | 3,113,864 | $280 |
| 16 | 152,846 | $13.76 |
| 64 | 41,284 | $3.72 |
| 256 | 13,393 | $1.21 |

**♻️ GAS TABLE RE-DERIVED 2026-08-01 with MEASURED bb 5.x proof sizes** (507 -> 286 fields, 16,224 ->
9,152 bytes). The proof is BATCH-level calldata so it amortises over N; the 7 public signals are
PER-withdrawal and do not. Model: `base/N + proof_bytes*16/N + 7*32*16`, base = 2.38M measured.

| N | old model (507-field) | **re-derived (286-field)** | saving |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2,643,168 | **2,530,016** | 113,152 |
| 4 | 663,480 | **635,192** | 28,288 |
| **16** | 168,558 | **161,486** | 7,072 |
| 64 | 44,828 | **43,060** | 1,768 |
| 256 | 13,895 | **13,453** | 442 |

At 30 gwei / $3,000 ETH: **N=16 = $14.53**, N=64 = $3.88. The smaller proof is worth ~7k gas per
withdrawal at N=16 - real, but modest, because the proof amortises while the per-withdrawal SIGNAL
calldata (3,584 gas) does not. **That signal term is now the floor**, and it is why N beyond ~64
stops paying: at N=256 the base verify is only ~9k of the 13.5k total.

**DECIDED (user, 2026-07-27): N=16.** It captures ~95% of the achievable saving. Beyond it the benefit decays as 1/N while prover
cost grows linearly, and calldata becomes the floor (a third of the total by N=256). Start at 16;
widen only if real volume justifies it — **a batch of 3 costs ~800k each, so at low volume the
discount never materialises at any N.**

**HARD CONSTRAINT: user-side proving must run on a Samsung A16** (budget phone, Knox enclave for key
custody). This is satisfied by construction and is a reason the split matters:
- The **user** proves only `withdraw_identity` — 44,176 gates, ~148 MiB, 1.33 s on a desktop i9.
  Memory is a non-issue on the phone; expect roughly 15-40 s wall-clock. **Unmeasured — measure on
  the actual device.**
- The **batcher** carries the ~56 GB aggregator. A phone never runs it.
- The recursion flavour (`--oracle_hash poseidon2 --honk_recursion 1`) does not change the user's
  circuit size — proof is still 507 fields — so the phone's cost is identical either way.

**INFRA:** a **batcher** (runs the aggregation prover — tens of GB, so realistically few operators,
though entry stays permissionless) and a **proof-relay endpoint** for users to submit to. Both can
run on SPV's fleet operationally; **the code lives in ibiza** to keep the one-way coupling
(sec. 7 — SPV's repo must contain zero PP references; sharing operators is free, sharing a repo is
not).

**UX:** withdrawal becomes **async** — you wait for a batch. Local proving is unchanged (~1.3 s
desktop). **The wallet MUST retain the witness until the withdrawal confirms**, so it can re-prove
with the keccak oracle if it ever needs to self-submit past a censoring batcher. An optimising
refactor will delete that retention; it is load-bearing for the escape hatch.

### 2.4c NO YIELD SUBSIDISATION — depositors keep their own yield (user, 2026-07-27)

**Directive: PP participants keep ALL of their yield, with the same UX as a regular SPV LP.** This
supersedes every earlier note in this file about yield funding gas subsidies, challenge bounties or
paymasters — **do not reintroduce those.**

**The obstacle, and the fix.** Yield cannot be credited per-depositor without per-user accounting,
and per-user accounting is exactly the linkage the pool destroys (PP-SPV-BUFFER-DESIGN sec. 2
forbids earmarking inside the Vogue position for this reason).

**Resolution: make notes SHARE-denominated, not value-denominated — the ERC-4626 pattern.** A note
commits to a *share count* rather than an absolute amount; the pool's assets grow with yield; the
withdrawal pays `shares x currentRate`. Yield then accrues to every note proportionally with
**zero per-user tracking and zero leakage**, and a PP depositor holds economically the same
instrument as an SPV LP — which is precisely the "same UX as a regular LP" requirement.
- Requires: `PrivacyPool` deposit/withdraw to denominate in shares, and the rate applied on the
  contract side at withdrawal (the circuit continues to prove share amounts, unchanged).
- **Known tension, must be designed around:** `shares x rate` produces distinctive, non-round
  withdrawal amounts, which worsens the amount-fingerprinting weakness that sec. 3's
  denomination-splitting is meant to fix. Splitting on *shares* rather than on payout value is the
  likely answer.
- This also removes the buffer design's awkwardness: idle capital earning yield is no longer a
  treasury question, it is the depositors' own return.

### 2.4d vBTC through PP — RULED OUT. It is not a bearer instrument; there is nothing to anonymise.

**Verdict reached in two corrections, both worth keeping so this is not re-proposed.**

**First draft said "mechanically viable"** on the strength of `Vault.sol:599` exposing a real
"vBTC ERC-20 + 4626 face" with standard `transfer`/`approve`, fungible 1:1 with sats. That checked
the token layer and stopped.

**Second look (user): the exit is channel-bound.** `unexposeBtcFromLev(address lp, uint sats)` takes
an LP address and is gated to `LEV_MANAGER_BTC`. True, and important — but not the deepest problem.

**Third look, and this is the decisive one: NOBODY EVER HOLDS vBTC.**
`exposeBtcToLev` mints with `emit Transfer(address(0), msg.sender, sats)` — and `msg.sender` is the
**LevManager**, not the LP. The manager holds it, supplies it to the Aave/Euler venue as collateral,
and burns it on close ("burn the sats vBTC the manager withdrew from the venue and convert the LP's
levered slice back to FREE channel band depth"). The LP never holds vBTC; the LP holds a **channel
band position**.

So vBTC is an **internal accounting token inside the leverage machinery**, not a BTC wrapper anyone
can custody. **There is no vBTC holder population to build an anonymity set from.** PP could
technically custody the ERC-20, and it would be pointless.

**The user's architectural instinct was also right: you cannot "just allow withdrawal to any
address" — that binding is load-bearing SECURITY, not a policy choice.** `BTCChannels.sol:477-496`
spells out why, and it is worth quoting because it is the reason a rearchitecture is not free:

> *"We REJECT any other output: without this, a malicious LP could route its withdrawal to a script
> != btcRecipientOf, making `_lpFinalBalance` read 0 -> `delivered = shrinkSats` -> over-claim the
> SHARED swap-out proceeds pool (cross-LP theft)."*

The contract cannot see *who* was paid, only *how much reached the committed script*. Free-form
outputs make the payout unmeasurable, so `delivered` becomes forgeable and one LP can drain the
shared pool. `btcRecipientOf` (the LP's upfront-shutdown P2TR key) is ONE source of truth for both
cooperative-close attribution and the on-chain splice path. **Unbinding it to gain anonymity would
trade a cryptoeconomic invariant for a privacy property — the wrong direction, and exactly the
hack-containment the user flagged.**

**"A different instrument" means precisely one thing: a token whose BURN PAYS THE BEARER in BTC**,
rather than one whose burn converts an LP's levered slice back to channel depth. vBTC's burn is an
LP *accounting operation*; a bearer instrument's burn is a *settlement*.

**The anonymity blocker and the LIQUIDATOR blocker are the same problem.** vBTC meets three of the
four requirements for an open lending market — transferable ERC-20, oracle (1:1 sats vs WBTC),
lenders possible — and fails the fourth: a liquidator who seizes vBTC holds a token only
`unexposeBtcFromLev` can burn, and that burn credits the LP, not the seizer. No redemption ⇒ no
liquidators ⇒ no rational lender. A PP withdrawer is in the identical position. **No bearer
redemption ⇒ no lending market AND no anonymity. Solving one solves both.**

It cannot be patched, because public redemption collides with an explicit invariant —
`Vault.sol:658` / `BtcLevManager.sol:570`: *"The LP never receives loose vBTC (that would
double-claim the same channel BTC)."* Same family as the `btcRecipientOf` binding above.

**⚠ IMPORTANT UPDATE (2026-07-27) — a bearer-delivery rail ALREADY EXISTS, and it defeats the
"unmeasurable payout" objection above.** `BTCChannels.requestSwapOutOnchain` → `deliverSwapOutOnchain`
delivers **real on-chain BTC to a plain Bitcoin address**. The recipient needs **no channel, no LN
node, no Lightning** — just an address. Delivery is gated to `channels[channelId].hop`, and the
protocol settles the hop afterwards via the `pendingSwapOutUsd` obligation.

*Correction to the framing: the script check is no longer the loose 22/25/34 length range.* It was
**tightened to P2TR-only today** (`BTCChannels.sol:1189-1197`): exactly 34 bytes AND prefix
`0x51 0x20`, because a length-only test accepts any 34-byte blob including a P2WSH the rest of the
stack cannot match. So the bearer address must be **key-path P2TR** — which is fine, the protocol is
taproot everywhere.

**Why this matters more than it looks:** §2.4d's central objection — *the contract cannot see WHO was
paid, only how much reached `btcRecipientOf`, so free-form outputs make `delivered` forgeable* — is
an argument about the **close / withdrawal splice** path. **The swap-out rail already solved it**, by
a different mechanism (`BTCChannels.sol:1221-1228`):

> *"delivered PINNED to the obligation … the delivered amount is NOT inferred from the tx outputs, so
> it cannot be inflated by routing the LP's change away from `btcRecipientOf`."*

Pinning `delivered` to the pre-recorded obligation (`so.sats`) instead of inferring it from outputs
is exactly the anti-over-claim property the `btcRecipientOf` binding was protecting. **A rail that
pays an arbitrary bearer address without breaking the cross-LP-theft invariant is already in the
codebase and shipping.** That substantially weakens the "option 2 is large and speculative" verdict
below — most of the accounting it needs exists.

**Three options, in order of what to actually do:**
1. **Put WBTC/tBTC through `PrivacyPoolComplex` — available TODAY, zero new design.** PP's ERC20
   pool already handles it, so anonymised BTC needs no architectural change. Cost: no SPV yield on
   that portion, since it is not channel BTC. **This is the recommendation.**
2. **A pooled-backing BTC token** — backed by AGGREGATE channel capacity and redeemable against any
   LP with capacity rather than the originator, dissolving the per-LP binding by construction.
   **← OWNED BY THE USER, in a parallel SPV thread (2026-07-27). Do not start it from the ibiza
   side.** Reclassified from "large and speculative" to "tractable" by the swap-out finding above.
   **Swap-out ≡ bearer redemption. What is missing is TWO THINGS, not a capability** (user,
   2026-07-27) — the recipient side is already solved, since swap-out takes a raw P2TR script and the
   hop pays an arbitrary address whose owner has no channel:

   1. **An entrypoint.** `exposeBtcToLev`/`unexposeBtcFromLev` are gated to `LEV_MANAGER_BTC`, so **no
      third party can burn vBTC**. A `redeemVBtc(sats, script, channelId)` would **reuse the existing
      rail wholesale** — `pendingSwapOutUsd` obligation, symmetric `swapOutUsed`/`swapInUsed` dedup,
      `requestBlock` self-refund timeout, failed-delivery reversal via `settleSwapIn` — with the USD
      intake (`creditSwapOut` pulling from `msg.sender`) replaced by a **token burn**.
   2. **Source-of-funds binding.** Swap-out names a `channelId` and is delivered by **that channel's
      hop**, so a liquidator is pinned to the originating LP. **The binding is about WHICH CHANNEL
      PAYS, not whether a bearer can be paid** — that is the one genuine design question, and the
      pooled-backing model is what answers it.

   Must not violate `Vault.sol:658` / `BtcLevManager.sol:570` (*"The LP never receives loose vBTC —
   that would double-claim the same channel BTC"*).
3. **Solve liquidator exit** — if SPV ever wants an open vBTC lending market it needs public
   redemption anyway, and that mechanism yields the anonymity for free. **The right trigger for
   revisiting this is SPV wanting the lending market, not PP wanting privacy.**

A permissioned market where the protocol backstops seizure (roughly what the per-LP escrow design
already approximates) solves the LENDING problem but **not** the anonymity one — permissioned means
identified.

### 2.4e Batcher decentralisation — an AVS secures the WRONG property. Do not use one.

**The batcher cannot forge.** The aggregate proof is verified on-chain, so validity is already
cryptographic. The only fault a batcher can commit is **refusing to include you** — liveness, not
soundness.

**That is why an AVS does not fit.** An AVS exists to make *attestations* trustworthy by putting
stake behind them. Our batcher makes no attestation; it produces a proof the chain checks itself.
So there is nothing to attest and nothing to economically secure. Slashing would have to target
censorship, which is **hard to attribute** — proving a batcher saw your proof and excluded it needs
a canonical mempool with proof-of-submission, which is more infrastructure than the thing it
protects. You would be adding staking, an operator registry and slashing logic to secure a property
that is already cryptographic, against a fault you cannot cleanly prove.

**What actually decentralises the batcher, in order of value:**
1. **The 16-wide TREE is the real lever** (sec. 2.4b). Each node is an INDEPENDENT ~56 GB job, so a
   deep batch can be built by MANY operators each proving one node, rather than one machine holding
   the whole thing. Flat N=64 needs a single ~225 GB box; a depth-2 tree reaching N=256 needs
   several ~56 GB boxes that never talk to each other. **Tree structure buys decentralisation that
   no amount of staking does.**
2. **Permissionless entry** — no registry, no stake, no whitelist. Nothing to capture.
3. **The escape hatch** — `PrivacyPool.withdraw` is untouched, so self-submission at full gas
   (~$280) always works. A censoring batcher costs you money, never access. That is the actual
   censorship bound, and it needs no slashing to enforce.
4. **Fee market** — batchers compete on the existing relay fee.

Residual honest weakness: ~56 GB is server-class, so expect FEW operators in practice even though
entry is open. That is *de facto* concentration without *de jure* permissioning, and an AVS would
not change it — an AVS registry would make it *more* permissioned, not less.

### 2.4f Upstreaming Honk into Aligned — real upside, but the same work as building our own

**The economics genuinely favour it, which is why it is worth stating precisely rather than
dismissing.** Aligned's aggregation service verifies its aggregate with a CHEAP outer system
(~300k gas) where ours pays UltraHonk's ~2.38M floor:

| N | ours (Honk outer) | Aligned (cheap outer) |
|---|---|---|
| 16 | 152,846 | **22,846** |
| 64 | 41,284 | **8,784** |
| 256 | 13,393 | **5,268** |

~7x better at our chosen N=16. Their aggregation service also has **full L1 hard finality** (one
proof verified on Ethereum), unlike their verification layer, which is restaking-backed "soft
finality" and wrong for a value-bearing pool.

**Effort to add Honk, split by product — the asymmetry is the whole point:**
- **Verification layer: EASY.** Operators run verification natively on bare metal; their docs call
  adding proof systems "straightforward". For UltraHonk that is essentially shelling out to
  `bb verify`. **But this is the weak-trust product — not usable here.**
- **Aggregation service: HARD.** Recursion requires an UltraHonk verifier running INSIDE their
  proving system (SP1/Risc0/Gnark). That means porting bb's verifier to zkVM-friendly Rust or a
  Gnark circuit — weeks to months of specialist cryptography that must be correct, since a bug
  forges proofs. **This is the SAME work as building our own aggregator**; it does not disappear,
  it relocates to a third party who audits and maintains it.

**Why not to pursue it now:** it makes our core cost structure depend on someone else's roadmap for
a launch-blocking property, and neither Noir nor Barretenberg appears anywhere in their docs or
roadmap. **Revisit only if Aligned ships Honk in the AGGREGATION service** (the hard-finality one) —
at which point the 7x is real and worth taking. Until then, build our own at N=16.

### 2.13b INVERT THE ASP: blacklist, not allowlist — and keep PP's labels alongside (user, 2026-07-27)

**The instruction:** stop maintaining a list of approved people. Membership should be proven
NEGATIVELY — "I am not on the blacklist" — and PP's original label-based screening should COEXIST
rather than be replaced.

**Why this is right.** An allowlist fails closed by omission: a postman who simply never admits you
censors you without ever acting, which is the same inaction lever §2.5a spent effort removing from
the revocation side. A blacklist fails OPEN — inaction means everyone can withdraw — and requires an
affirmative, rule-bound act to exclude anyone. It also enlarges the anonymity set from "everyone
admitted" to "everyone not excluded", which is strictly larger and does not shrink when the postman
is slow.

**⚠ THE TRAP: a blacklist over identities is trivially evaded on its own.** If a withdrawal only
proves `holderRoot ∉ blacklist`, an attacker generates a fresh random `sk_identity`, derives a
holderRoot nobody has listed, and passes. The check is vacuous. **A negative proof is only
meaningful against a scarce identity** — something you cannot mint more of.

**The resolution, and it needs no new trust:** pair the negative proof with INCLUSION IN THE
PERMISSIONLESS REGISTERED-IDENTITY SET. `HolderRegistration.registerDocumentViaNoir` already
registers a `holderRoot` against a Noir proof binding a real passport's DG1, and it is **not
role-gated** — anyone with a valid passport can register and nobody can decline them. So inclusion
there is proof-of-personhood, NOT approval. The distinction is the whole point: an allowlist is
someone's decision, a registration set is a fact about holding a passport.

**Target shape of a withdrawal proof:**
1. `holderRoot ∈ registered identities` — permissionless, scarce, nobody's discretion.
2. `holderRoot ∉ blacklist` — rule-bound (§2.5), fail-open, latest root never expires.
3. *optionally* `label ∈ ASP-screened set` — PP's ORIGINAL chain-analysis screening, preserved as a
   separate predicate a deployment may enable, rather than deleted.

That is what "coexist" means concretely: two independent gates on different properties — who you
are, and which association set your deposit sits in — neither replacing the other, and neither being
an approval list. (Precisely: the ASP performs chain analysis OFF-CHAIN to curate the set; the
circuit proves MEMBERSHIP of it. Nothing proves where the money came from — that is dissociation,
not provenance, and conflating the two overstates what a deployment can claim.)

**What this changes in the code:** `IdentityAspRegistry` stops being the gate (it becomes either the
registered-identity mirror or is dropped in favour of reading rarime's own registration state);
`withdraw_identity` swaps `identity_asp_membership` (inclusion in an ADMITTED set) for inclusion in
the REGISTERED set, keeping the existing `smt_verifier_full` exclusion; PP's label predicate returns
as an optional public input. The exclusion machinery already exists and is tested — this is a change
of which tree is consulted, not new cryptography.

**Open, and the reason this is recorded before it is built:** whether the label predicate is
per-pool configuration or a global toggle, and whether the registered-identity set is read from
rarime's SMT directly or mirrored into a PP-side registry (the mirror costs a sync, the direct read
costs a cross-contract dependency on an upgradeable rarime contract — which §2.5a would object to).

### 2.13c THE BLACKLIST MUST BE SECRET — options weighed, epoch pseudonyms recommended

**Constraint (user, 2026-07-27): who is on the blacklist is itself confidential.** §2.13b's design
publishes an SMT of blacklisted `holderRoot`s. That is unacceptable: registered identities are
public on-chain, so anyone can hash every registered holderRoot against the published tree and
recover the entire list by brute force. Publishing the tree publishes the list.

**THE CORE TENSION, stated before the options.** To prove non-membership WITHOUT a trusted issuer,
the prover must know the set — a Merkle non-inclusion path requires the surrounding tree. If the
prover knows the set, the set is public. **So "secret list" and "trustless non-inclusion proof"
cannot both hold as stated.** Every option below is a choice about which one bends.

**Option A — public list (status quo).** Trustless, fail-open, already built and tested.
*Cons:* no confidentiality at all. **Fine for OFAC SDN, which IS a published list — its secrecy is
not a requirement.** Useless for suspicion/law-enforcement predicates, which are secret by nature.

**Option B — issuer-signed non-membership credentials.** The authority signs "holderRoot X is not
listed as of epoch T"; the circuit verifies the signature instead of a tree path.
*Pros:* list never published in any form; simple circuit.
*Cons:* **reintroduces exactly the failure §2.13b exists to remove.** An issuer that declines to
sign censors you by inaction, indistinguishably from being slow. This is the allowlist again wearing
a different hat.

**Option C — cryptographic accumulator (RSA / bilinear) with non-membership witnesses.**
*Pros:* constant-size state; genuine non-membership witnesses exist.
*Cons:* computing a witness requires knowing the accumulated set, so either the prover knows it
(public again) or the issuer computes it (Option B again). Witness updates on every change are a
standing liveness burden. **Buys nothing over B while costing far more machinery.**

**Option D — EPOCH PSEUDONYM LIST. ← RECOMMENDED**
Each user holds a revocation secret `s`, shared with the authority at registration and bound to
their `holderRoot`. For epoch `T`, the authority publishes the list of `P = PRF(s, T)` for revoked
users only. The list is PUBLIC — so non-inclusion is trustlessly provable — but every entry is an
opaque PRF output that cannot be linked to an identity without `s`.

The withdrawal proves, with the pseudonym as a **PRIVATE** input:
1. `holderRoot ∈ registered` (permissionless, scarce — §2.13b's trap fix)
2. `P = PRF(s, T)` and `s` is the secret bound to that `holderRoot`
3. `P ∉ blacklist_T`

*Why it resolves the tension:* the SET is public (so anyone can build a path, no issuer in the
proving path) while the MEMBERSHIP is opaque (entries are PRF outputs). It fails OPEN — an authority
that does nothing publishes an empty or stale list and everybody withdraws. And it cannot be evaded,
because `s` is bound to a registered identity, so a fresh `s` fails step 2.

*What it leaks:* the SIZE of the revoked set per epoch, and nothing else on-chain. `P` never appears
publicly — it is a private input, so the authority (which knows every `s`) still cannot link a
withdrawal to a user.

*What it costs, honestly:* the authority holds a per-user secret, so a breach grants the ability to
revoke anyone (NOT to deanonymize — pseudonyms stay private). Users must fetch the current epoch's
list, which is public data, so no per-user issuance and no refusal surface. Epoch granularity bounds
how quickly a revocation takes effect, exactly like `MAX_ROOT_AGE` already does.

**Recommendation: A for public predicates, D for secret ones — and they compose.** OFAC is published;
forcing it through D would add a shared secret for no confidentiality gain. A deployment enables
whichever predicates it needs, and the circuit checks non-inclusion in each configured tree. The
exclusion gadget is identical for both — only the leaf derivation differs (`holderRoot` vs
`PRF(s, T)`), so D is largely a key-derivation change over machinery already built and tested.

**RESIDUAL COST OF SECRECY, AND IT IS NOT SMALL — SECRECY DESTROYS AUDITABILITY.** §2.5 exists to
make revocation PROVABLY RULE-BOUND: a revocation must cite a predicate, and anyone can check that
it did. A confidential list breaks that check for everyone except the authority — if observers
cannot see WHO was listed, they cannot verify the listing followed a rule, and "provably rule-bound"
degrades to "asserted rule-bound". Option D fixes the CENSORSHIP-BY-INACTION problem, and it does
not fix this one; no option above does, because the two properties are in genuine tension.

The mitigation, if it is wanted, is a ZK proof of CORRECT LISTING: alongside each published
pseudonym the authority proves in zero-knowledge that the corresponding identity satisfies a
declared predicate, without revealing the identity. That restores auditability at real cost (a proof
per listing, and each predicate must be expressible in-circuit — which the OFAC one currently is
NOT, since the linkage from a holderRoot to a listed person does not exist on-chain at all; see
backend/cre/sanctions_lists/main.go's own note on this). Recorded as the honest price rather than buried:
adopting D means accepting weaker auditability than §2.5 promises until that proof exists.

**Open before building D:** which PRF (Poseidon over `(s, T)` keeps it in-circuit-cheap and reuses
the audited hash), epoch length, and how `s` is delivered to the authority at registration
(encrypted to a published authority key is the obvious route, and wants its own scrutiny).

### 2.13d SCOPED: escrow-bound revocation secret. MEASURED, and the cost lands off the hot path

Closes §2.13c's soundness hole (nothing forced a user to pick an `s` the authority knows, so anyone
could be permanently unrevokable) WITHOUT an authority interaction that could be refused.

**Mechanism.** The user encrypts `s` to the authority's published BabyJubJub key with HASHED ELGAMAL
— `C1 = r*G`, `C2 = s + Poseidon(r*PK_A)` — and posts the ciphertext ON-CHAIN with a proof it is
well-formed and encrypts the `s` they committed to. No approval step exists, so there is nothing to
withhold. BabyJubJub is already the curve: `pp/src/jubjub.nr` has the 254-bit ladder and point
addition, and the only new primitive is that ladder generalised to an ARBITRARY base (`priv_to_pub`
hardcodes G), which is a ten-line change.

**MEASURED with `nargo info`, 1.0.0-beta.13 — not estimated:**

| circuit | ACIR opcodes | note |
|---|---|---|
| `withdraw_identity` today | 43,772 | baseline |
| `register_identity` today | 72,932 | baseline |
| `register_identity_light_td1` today | 16,180 | baseline |
| hashed-ElGamal escrow proof | **23,727** | dominated by 2 scalar mults (~11.8k each) |
| withdrawal add, SEPARATE escrow tree | 7,895 (**+18%**) | the depth-20 inclusion is nearly all of it |
| withdrawal add, escrow folded into the REGISTERED LEAF | **8** (+0.02%) | ← the shape to build |

**The shape those numbers pick.** Do NOT put the encryption in a registration circuit: it is +33% on
`register_identity` and **+147%** on the light TD1 path, which would be the worst place to spend it.
Do NOT give escrow its own tree either — that costs 7,895 opcodes on EVERY withdrawal forever.
Instead:

1. **Registered-identity leaf becomes `Poseidon(holder_root, Poseidon(s))`.** The withdrawal already
   proves inclusion of that leaf, so the escrow binding rides along for free.
2. **Escrow is a SEPARATE, ONE-TIME, PERMISSIONLESS transaction** carrying the 23,727-opcode proof
   that the posted ciphertext encrypts the `s` committed in that leaf. Both registration circuits
   stay untouched.
3. **Withdrawal adds 8 opcodes**: derive `P = Poseidon(s, epoch)`, and swap the blacklist leaf from
   `holder_root` to `P`. The depth-20 exclusion gadget it runs today is REUSED as-is — this is a
   leaf-derivation change, not new machinery.

Recurring cost is therefore ~zero and the whole price is paid once, off the hot path.

**REQUIRED GUARD: assert `r != 0`.** With `r = 0` the shared secret degenerates to the identity
point, so the mask is a public constant and `C2` reveals `s` TO EVERYONE. That would let any
observer test the published pseudonym list for that user — the exact confidentiality the design
exists to provide. A degenerate `r` looks like a valid encryption and would pass every other check.

**Residual costs, stated plainly:** the authority can decrypt every `s`, so it can revoke anyone —
that IS the intended power, and a key compromise grants revocation (denial of service) but NOT
deanonymisation, since `P` is a private input and never appears on-chain. §2.13c's auditability loss
is unchanged by any of this.

**Open:** epoch length, and whether the escrow record is required before the FIRST withdrawal or
before the first deposit.

### 2.13e CORRECTION: the epoch was redundant, and the blacklist is the REVOCATION REGISTRY

Supersedes the epoch-based parts of §2.13c/§2.13d. Both were challenged by the user on efficiency
grounds and both were wrong; recorded here rather than silently edited, because the REASON generalises.

**The epoch bought nothing.** The pseudonym `P` is a PRIVATE circuit input and never appears
on-chain, so there is nothing to track across withdrawals and therefore nothing to rotate for. The
rotation was imported from anonymous-credential revocation, where pseudonyms ARE revealed — that is
the premise that makes rotation necessary, and it does not hold here. Root freshness was ALREADY
solved by `RevocationRegistry`'s `MAX_ROOT_AGE` + always-valid-latest, so the epoch was a second
notion of time doing the first one's job. Drop it: `P = Poseidon(s)`, published when it changes.

*(This is the third mechanism imported from a context whose premise does not hold here — after the
revocation root policy borrowed from the ASP's inclusion semantics, and the accumulator option that
never asked who computes the witness. The failure mode is reusing a mechanism without re-checking
its premise, and it is worth a deliberate check on anything else borrowed wholesale.)*

**THE BIGGER ONE: the identity blacklist and the revocation registry are the SAME OBJECT.**
`RevocationRegistry` already holds "identities that may not withdraw", proven by exclusion at depth
20. The blacklist being designed is that tree with a different leaf derivation. Building both would
have duplicated two contracts, two roots, two public inputs and two witness paths for one job.
§2.13's blacklist IS §2.5's revocation registry made CONFIDENTIAL — leaves become `Poseidon(s)`
instead of `holder_root`, which is exactly the secrecy upgrade and nothing more.

**Second merge, from the user's observation that ONE authority writes both lists:** the tainted-label
entries belong in that same tree — `Poseidon(s)` keys persons, `Poseidon(s, label)` keys flagged
deposits, distinct preimages so they cannot collide. One contract, one root, one validity check.
Still two exclusion PATHS (~7,895 opcodes); it is the contract/root duplication that goes.

**Checked and clean:** root expiry must NOT extend to the registered set — it is an INCLUSION tree,
where old roots have FEWER members and are therefore safe. Only exclusion trees need expiry.
Registered-set inclusion and the escrow binding are already ONE proof, since the leaf is
`Poseidon(holder_root, Poseidon(s))`.

**Resulting shape** — two trees beyond PP's state tree, no epoch, both identity and label screening
live, everything failing open:

| gate | tree | key |
|---|---|---|
| note exists, unspent | state (LeanIMT) | commitment |
| registered + escrowed | registered mirror (inclusion) | `Poseidon(holder_root, Poseidon(s))` |
| person not listed | exclusion tree | `Poseidon(s)` |
| deposit not flagged | SAME exclusion tree | `Poseidon(s, label)` |

### 2.13f CORRECTION: "no cryptographic invariant across passports" was too broad — build these

Challenged by the user, and the challenge was right. Two DIFFERENT things were blurred: DERIVING a
person-linkage from document contents (genuinely limited) and ENFORCING document-level uniqueness
(entirely possible, and currently NOT DONE).

**THE HOLE — CORRECTED AFTER READING THE CODE. My first description of it was wrong.** I claimed
`HolderRegistration` had no `documentKey -> holderRoot` mapping. It effectively does: `addDocument`
requires `status == DocStatus.None`, status only ever moves None -> Current -> Superseded/Revoked and
NEVER back, and `_usedDocumentHash` is set-only. So a document key cannot be re-bound.

The REAL defect is one level down, and sharper. `_verifyNoirZKProof` binds exactly three public
signals — `dgCommit`, `dg1Hash`, `holderRoot`. But the uniqueness guard was keyed on
`passport_.passportHash`, and the document identity on `passport_.publicKey`, and **NEITHER OF THOSE
IS CONSTRAINED BY THE PROOF** — both are caller-supplied struct fields attested only by the backend
signer's signature. So the guard keyed on values the proof never checks, while a proof-bound value
sat unused beside them. Anyone able to obtain a signature could present a FRESH `publicKey` and
`passportHash` for the SAME physical passport and bind it to a SECOND `holderRoot`; the proof still
verifies, because nothing ties those fields to the document. That defeats any identity-level
blacklist by construction: get listed, re-register, withdraw as someone new.

FIX (landed): feed the anti-replay guard `dg1Hash` instead of `passportHash`, and reject zero on
this path. `dg1Hash` is computed IN-CIRCUIT as `passport_hash(dg1)` over the MRZ, so it is
deterministic per passport and unforgeable. No new storage, no signature change — the guard already
existed and was simply being fed the wrong value. Zero must be rejected HERE because `addDocument`
treats a zero hash as "no anti-replay wanted" and skips the check entirely.

Renewal is unaffected: a renewed passport has a new MRZ, hence a new `dg1Hash`. Verified by
reverting the fix — 5 of the 6 new tests fail without it, and `test_renewalStillWorksUnderTheDg1Guard`
passes both ways by design, being the regression guard rather than an attack.

**TWO MORE THAT HOLD:**
- **Mandatory authenticated DG1 in the envelope** — the full MRZ, not a digest. The controller
  receives name, DOB, sex, nationality and document number PASSPORT-SIGNED via the ICAO chain, which
  is STRONGER than conventional KYC where documents can be forged.
- **The MRZ personal-number field** (TD3 line 2, 14 chars) carries a national ID in many states.
  Where populated it links one person's documents from the same issuer cryptographically.

**WHERE IT STOPS, AND WHY IT MUST.** Cross-STATE, different-name linkage. ICAO 9303 defines no field
shared between two states' passports for the same person. The available quasi-identifier is
DOB + sex + place of birth, and thousands of people collide on it — making it a hard key would BLOCK
INNOCENT PEOPLE from withdrawing. That false-positive cost is why it stays a fuzzy match rather than
a cryptographic one; the harm from a wrong hard key is borne by someone who did nothing.

Accurate claim, replacing the too-broad one: the protocol enforces that NO DOCUMENT ESCAPES THE
CONTROLLER'S VIEW and NO DOCUMENT CAN BE RE-HOMED. Cross-state person-linkage is fuzzy matching on
UNFORGEABLE inputs — the same matching sanctions screening already performs, on better data.

**PREDICATE CITATION: an event is not enough (user).** Events are log data — not contract state, not
readable on-chain, droppable by any indexer. The exclusion SMT is key->value and its VALUE SLOT IS
CURRENTLY WASTED (always 0). Store the predicate THERE: covered by the root, part of the committed
state, impossible to omit or prune, and exactly what a ZK proof-of-correct-listing must prove
against. Costs nothing — the field exists and is being filled with zero. Strictly stronger than an
event, and it drops the per-predicate attester mapping's misconfiguration surface without losing
the record.

### 2.13g CANCELLED: the SMT swap for the registered mirror. Measured, and it is a net loss

Step 2 of the §2.13 build order, dropped before implementation on its own numbers.

**Claimed:** swapping the registered mirror from LeanIMT to SparseMerkleTree would be free or
cheaper, drop the `asp_tree_depth` public input, and leave ONE proof gadget instead of two.

**Measured with `nargo info`, capacity-matched at depth 32 (~4 billion identities):**

| gadget | ACIR opcodes |
|---|---|
| `lean_imt_inclusion` (current) | 10,575 |
| `smt_verifier_full` inclusion (proposed) | **11,856** |

The swap COSTS +1,281 opcodes (+12%) on every withdrawal. The earlier "SMT is cheaper" figure
compared depth-20 SMT (7,889) against depth-32 LeanIMT — different capacities, so not a comparison
at all. The registered set is the LARGE tree; the depth-20 figure belongs to the blacklist, which
holds thousands, not millions.

**And the main justification was false.** PP's own state tree uses `lean_imt_inclusion` too
(withdraw_identity/src/main.nr:81) and is not changing, so LeanIMT stays in the trusted base
regardless. The swap does not remove a gadget — it only changes which tree uses which. That claim
was made without checking the tree three lines above the one being changed.

Net: pay +12% per withdrawal to drop one public input. Not worth it. `asp_tree_depth` stays, and its
existing safety argument holds — a false depth simply fails to reconstruct the root, so no separate
range check is needed.

**What survives from the original step 2:** nothing. The key->value property that motivated "SMT
everywhere" is wanted only for the EXCLUSION tree's predicate slot (§2.13f), and that tree is
ALREADY a SparseMerkleTree.

### 2.13h Step 3 was ALREADY DONE; step 4's ladder landed, and the r=0 degeneracy is now measured

**Step 3 (predicate into the SMT value slot) needed no work — it already exists.**
`RevocationRegistry.revoke` does `_tree.add(holderRoot_, predicate_)`, with a comment saying exactly
why: "the tree records not just that an identity was revoked but under which rule - auditable after
the fact without trusting the event log." My §2.13f claim that "the value slot is currently wasted,
always 0" came from reading the CIRCUIT's exclusion call - which passes 0 because exclusion does not
use a value - and generalising to the contract without opening it. The user's concern that an event
is not enough was already answered by the code.

**Step 4, part one: `mul_point` (arbitrary-base scalar multiplication) landed in pp/src/jubjub.nr.**
This was the ONLY primitive the hashed-ElGamal envelope was missing - sealing to the controller's
key needs `r*PK`, not just `r*G`. `priv_to_pub` now DELEGATES to it rather than carrying a second
copy of the same 254-iteration ladder.

*Safety of touching `priv_to_pub`, which defines `holder_root`:* the ACIR is BYTE-IDENTICAL after the
refactor - `withdraw_identity` measures 43,772 opcodes before and after - so no verifier key changes
and nothing needs redeploying. Differential vectors against @iden3/js-crypto (base 7*G, four
scalars including a full-width one) plus `test_priv_to_pub_agrees_with_mul_point` pin the delegation.

**THE r=0 DEGENERACY IS NOW MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED.** `mul_point(P, 0)` returns **(0,0)**, NOT the
curve identity (0,1) - this ladder uses (0,0) as its empty-accumulator sentinel, and (0,0) does not
satisfy the curve equation at all. The test was written asserting (0,1) and FAILED, which is how the
real value was established.

That makes the `r != 0` guard concrete: with r=0 the shared secret is (0,0) for EVERY controller key,
so the mask `Poseidon2([0,0])` is a public constant and `C2 = s + mask` discloses the sealed
revocation secret to anyone who looks. Base-independent, so the leak is universal rather than
key-specific. Both facts are asserted in
`test_mul_point_by_zero_returns_the_sentinel_not_the_identity`.

### 2.13i Step 4 COMPLETE: the escrow envelope proves, verifies on-chain, and costs 37,384

`pp/src/envelope.nr` (hashed ElGamal over Baby Jubjub) + the `escrow_envelope` circuit + a generated
Solidity verifier that has ACCEPTED A REAL PROOF. End to end: JS witness -> nargo execute -> bb
write_vk -> bb prove -> bb verify -> on-chain `forge test`.

**COST CORRECTION - 37,384 ACIR opcodes, not the 23,727 quoted in §2.13d.** That estimate missed a
THIRD scalar multiplication (deriving `holder_root` from `sk_identity`) and used Poseidon2 rather
than the circomlib Poseidon this codebase actually shares with the wallet and poseidon-solidity.
Three scalar mults at ~11.8k each dominate. It is a ONE-TIME, off-hot-path cost, so the conclusion
stands; the number was wrong by 58%.

**Why `holder_root` is PROVEN and not supplied** (the third scalar mult, and worth its cost): if the
caller could name any holder root, an attacker would escrow a commitment to a secret of THEIR
choosing against a VICTIM's identity. The victim's withdrawal - which proves its `s` matches the
escrowed commitment - would then fail forever. Requiring knowledge of `sk_identity` makes escrow
self-service only.

**The r=0 guard is exercised, not merely present.** Four negative witnesses were run and each fails
with its own assertion: zero ephemeral, holder_root not derived from sk_identity, commitment not
matching the sealed secret, tampered ciphertext.

**EIP-170 - THE NEW VERIFIER DID NOT FIT.** At the default optimizer setting it compiled to 25,503
bytes, 927 OVER the 24,576 limit and undeployable. It has 8 public inputs, more than any other
circuit here, and each costs runtime code. Fixed by scoping `optimizer_runs = 1` to it in
foundry.toml, exactly as the other three verifiers already do -> 24,490 bytes, 86 bytes of headroom.
This surfaces ONLY at deploy time, so `forge build --sizes` must be checked after any change that
adds a public input.

**Regenerating all four verifiers confirmed the jubjub refactor was ACIR-neutral**: the three
existing verifiers came out byte-identical (no git diff), which is the strongest available evidence
that delegating `priv_to_pub` to `mul_point` did not fork `holder_root`.

**Cross-implementation, not a self-consistent loop:** every public input in the fixture was produced
by @iden3/js-crypto - the same babyJub and Poseidon the wallet uses - and then accepted by the Noir
circuit and the Solidity verifier.

**Still open on this circuit:** the sealed `document_attribute` is currently ONE field supplied by
the caller. §2.13f wants the FULL authenticated DG1 sealed so the controller can attribute
registrations to a person across passports; that needs the DG1 bytes re-hashed in-circuit to bind
them to the proof-bound `dg1Hash`, whose cost has NOT been measured. Sealing more fields is nearly
free (one shared secret, ~8 opcodes per extra mask); re-hashing DG1 is the unknown.

### 2.13j The FULL DG1 is sealed - measured, and two claims in §2.13i were wrong

**Closes §2.13f's attribution requirement and §2.13i's one open item.** The envelope now carries the
entire authenticated MRZ, not a caller-supplied placeholder field.

**Why the whole MRZ and not a digest.** A person may hold several passports under different names,
and ICAO 9303 defines no field linking two states' documents for one person, so the controller must
perform that attribution itself - which it can only do from the ACTUAL MRZ (name, date of birth,
nationality, document number). A hash lets it VERIFY a guess but never FORM one. So the MRZ rides
inside the envelope: opaque on-chain, readable only by the controller, bound by `dg1_hash` to the
same bytes registration already pinned.

**MEASURED - it looked expensive and is not:**

| | ACIR opcodes |
|---|---|
| sealing 4 fields, no binding | 25,146 |
| + sha256 binding over 95 bytes | 25,542 (**+396**) |
| escrow_envelope, single placeholder attribute | 37,384 |
| escrow_envelope, full sealed MRZ | **38,874** (+1,490, +4%) |

sha256 costs only 396 ACIR opcodes because it is a BLACKBOX gadget, not unrolled arithmetic (Brillig
opcodes go 26 -> 611). Extra sealed fields are ~8 opcodes each, since ONE shared secret covers the
whole payload. One-time and off the hot path.

**TWO CLAIMS IN §2.13i WERE WRONG, both about the EIP-170 incident:**
1. "It has 8 public inputs, more than any other circuit here" - `withdraw_identity` has NINE.
2. "each public input costs runtime code", implying input count drove the overflow. MEASURED across
   all four verifiers: TitleHolder (2 inputs) 24,491; Ragequit (4) 24,489; Withdrawal (9) 24,491;
   EscrowEnvelope (12) 24,491. **Verifier size is essentially FLAT in public-input count.** The
   25,503-byte overflow was caused ENTIRELY by the missing `optimizer_runs = 1` scoping. Going from
   8 to 12 public inputs moved the size by ONE byte.

**The digest-packing convention is copied deliberately, not cleaned up.** `register_identity_light`
skips `digest[0]` and reads the remaining 31 bytes big-endian. The obvious `digest[0..31]` yields a
DIFFERENT field, so `dg1_hash` would not equal the `dg1Hash` that
`RegistrationSimple._verifyNoirZKProof` binds and that `HolderStateKeeper` now stores as the
document anti-replay key (§2.13f). The escrow would bind the MRZ to a value nothing else agrees
with, and no test outside the escrow circuit would catch it.

**Test hardening:** the forge test now READS both the proof and a committed `escrow_envelope.public`
fixture, and asserts the named constants MATCH the fixture rather than being the source of truth.
Hand-transcribing twelve 77-digit field elements was the obvious place for this test to rot - a typo
would have failed for a reason unrelated to the verifier. 5 tests: real proof verifies, fixture is
the documented witness, all 12 inputs binding, sealed slots pairwise distinct, malformed rejected.

### 2.13k SUPERSEDES step 5: ONE identity tree, no sk_identity in the withdrawal. -43% MEASURED

Step 5 was "change the RevocationRegistry leaf to Poseidon(s)". Doing it exposed something larger:
`membership.holder_root` is used for EXACTLY ONE thing in `withdraw_identity` - as the revocation
key. Once that key becomes the escrow commitment, **the withdrawal does not need `holder_root`, and
therefore does not need `sk_identity`, at all.** Identity is checked ONCE, at escrow, where
`escrow_envelope` already proves `holder_root` from `sk_identity` and binds the MRZ.

And the two identity trees collapse into one. Key = the escrow commitment; VALUE carries status:
`0` = registered and clean, non-zero = the revocation predicate (which §2.13f established is
already stored there). So a SINGLE INCLUSION proof of `commitment -> 0` replaces BOTH the ASP
inclusion and the revocation exclusion.

**MEASURED, capacity-matched at depth 32:**

| | ACIR opcodes |
|---|---|
| `withdraw_identity` today | 43,772 |
| proposed, one tree, no sk_identity | **24,812** |
| | **-18,960 (-43%)** |

Where it comes from: the ASP scalar multiplication disappears (~11.8k), and one LeanIMT inclusion
plus one SMT exclusion (~18.5k combined) become one SMT inclusion (~11.9k).

**Soundness.** Scarcity still holds: commitments enter the tree ONLY via `escrow_envelope`, which
proves a registered, uniquely-bound document. Fail-open still holds: a controller that does nothing
leaves every value at 0 and every withdrawal works. Knowing `s` rather than `sk_identity` is
equivalent authorisation - neither spends a note, which needs the note secrets; both only satisfy
the clearance gate.

**THE ROOT-POLICY TRAP THIS CREATES, and it is the one I have already shipped once.** §2.13e recorded
that inclusion trees need NO root expiry (old roots have fewer members, so they are safe) while
exclusion trees REQUIRE it. A merged tree does BOTH jobs, so it MUST take the STRICTER policy:
`MAX_ROOT_AGE` plus always-valid-latest. Without expiry, a revoked identity proves `commitment -> 0`
against a root from before its revocation, forever. This is exactly the asymmetry I argued should be
kept in separate contracts precisely so it could not be confused - merging the trees gives that
argument up, so the policy has to be enforced in code and tested directly.

### 2.13l TITLE PATH CONSISTENCY: three confirmed defects (user, 2026-07-28)

User's framing: *"titleholder is just another document like a second passport, the only thing is
that it links two identities, the titleholder and the certified identity of a notary attesting the
title."* Checked against the code, and it does not currently work that way:

1. **`DOC_NOTARIAL_TITLE` is declared and NEVER USED.** `HolderStateKeeper.sol:66` defines it
   alongside DOC_PASSPORT / DOC_NATIONAL_ID / DOC_MDL / DOC_EUDI_PID; a repo-wide grep finds no
   other reference. The document model already has a slot for titles and nothing puts one there.

2. **`TitleLedger` does not touch `HolderStateKeeper` at all.** A title is a parallel structure
   (`mapping(uint256 => bytes32) holderCommitment`), NOT a document under a holder root. So a title
   gets none of the document machinery: no `dg1Hash`-style uniqueness guard (§2.13f), no
   supersede/revoke lifecycle, no multi-document-per-identity accounting. If a title is "just
   another document", it should register through the same path a second passport does.

3. **The notary is an ADDRESS, not a certified identity.** `address notary` and
   `mapping(address => bytes32) notaryDataHash`. TitleLedger's own header already flags this as an
   OPEN GAP - "binding a real-world notary's identity to an on-chain signing address ... still isn't
   cryptographically proven". Under the user's framing the notary should be a REGISTERED
   `holder_root` like anyone else, so that attesting a title links two identities rather than an
   identity and a keypair. That also folds the notary into §2.13k's single identity tree, making a
   notary revocable by the same mechanism as everyone else - which an address can never be.

**Consequence for §2.13k:** if titles become documents and notaries become identities, both sit in
the SAME merged tree, and `title_holder`'s commitment `Poseidon(holder_root, title_id)` should be
reconsidered against the escrow commitment so there is one identity key rather than two conventions.
NOT changed yet - recorded so the merged-tree work does not land while the title path still uses a
second, incompatible identity notion.

### 2.13m MERGE TRAPS: enumerated, and the two fatal ones are now TESTED CLOSED

Before landing §2.13k's single identity tree, the traps in "status lives in the VALUE" were hunted
deliberately rather than assumed away. Two would have been fatal and silent; both are now pinned by
tests in pp/src/smt.nr (84 pp tests pass).

**TRAP 1 - would `key -> 0` be indistinguishable from ABSENCE?** If so, ANY unregistered identity
could prove the clean state and withdraw, and the gate would be vacuous for exactly the population
it exists to exclude. NOT vacuous: leaf hashing is `Poseidon(key, value, 1)`, so `leaf(k, 0)` is a
non-zero hash while an empty node is literal `0`, and the two cannot collide.
`test_absent_key_cannot_be_proven_present_with_value_zero` asserts it.

**TRAP 2 - is the VALUE actually binding?** If a leaf's value could be misreported, a REVOKED
identity would claim 0 and withdraw, defeating revocation entirely. It is binding:
`test_a_revoked_entry_cannot_claim_value_zero` proves key=7 (present with value 77 in the reference
tree) CANNOT be shown to hold 0. Plus `test_inclusion_with_value_zero_is_provable` (the clean case
must genuinely work) and `test_value_zero_inclusion_still_binds_the_root`.

NONE of these were covered before, because no caller had ever passed value 0 - the existing
inclusion test uses 77. The merged design is the first thing to depend on that path.

**REMAINING TRAPS, to enforce when the merge lands:**

- **ROOT EXPIRY IS NOW MANDATORY.** §2.13e recorded that inclusion trees need none and exclusion
  trees require it. The merged tree does BOTH jobs, so it must take the STRICTER policy
  (`MAX_ROOT_AGE` + always-valid-latest). Without it a revoked identity proves `commitment -> 0`
  against a pre-revocation root FOREVER. This is the asymmetry I argued should stay in separate
  contracts precisely so it could not be confused; merging surrenders that structural protection, so
  it must be enforced in code and tested directly.
- **`predicate != 0` MUST BE REJECTED.** Zero is the CLEAN sentinel, so a zero predicate would
  "revoke" an identity into the clean state. Negligible by accident, fatal if reachable.
- **`remove` MUST NEVER BE EXPOSED.** `@solarity` `Bytes32SMT` provides `add`, `update` AND
  `remove`. `update` is what revocation needs (0 -> predicate, one-way, guarded by the existing
  `isRevoked` mapping). `remove` would DELETE a registration - censorship by erasure, and precisely
  the "postman can drop an existing member" failure the append-only design was built to prevent.
  It must not be reachable from any external function.
- **TWO WRITERS, ONE TREE.** Escrow adds `commitment -> 0` permissionlessly (proof-gated); only the
  controller may update to a predicate. One tree with two different access rules is workable but is
  where an access-control mistake would hide.

### 2.13n MERGE LANDED (contract half): IdentityRegistry, with every trap guarded and tested

`contracts/registry/IdentityRegistry.sol` + 16 tests driving the REAL escrow proof through the REAL
verifier into the REAL state keeper. 280 forge tests, 84 pp tests, ABI check clean.

**A SIXTH TRAP, found while writing the contract and NOT on the §2.13m list.** `escrow_envelope`
proves an MRZ hashes to `dg1_hash` and that `holder_root` derives from `sk_identity`. It CANNOT prove
the passport is GENUINE - the ICAO signature chain is verified during REGISTRATION, not escrow. So a
caller could invent an MRZ, produce a perfectly valid escrow proof, and land a commitment in the
identity tree backed by no real document. That would make the tree's scarcity guarantee, and
therefore the entire blacklist, worthless - the exact vacuity §2.13b's trap was about, re-entering
one layer down. Closed by requiring `HolderStateKeeper.holderOfDocumentHash(dg1Hash) == holderRoot`,
which needed a new `dg1Hash -> holderRoot` mapping (`_usedDocumentHash` recorded THAT a hash was
consumed, never BY WHOM). Two tests: unregistered document, and document bound to another holder.

**A SEVENTH, found by a failing test.** `isValidRoot(bytes32(0))` returned TRUE: the empty tree's
root IS zero and the constructor records it. Harmless in practice - an inclusion path always ends at
a non-zero leaf hash, so nothing can be proven against an empty root - but `State.sol::_isKnownRoot`
already rejects zero and the two must not disagree about what a zero root means. Now rejected
explicitly.

**All six earlier traps are guarded AND pinned by a test that fails if the guard is removed:**

| trap | guard | test |
|---|---|---|
| root expiry mandatory (merged tree does BOTH jobs) | `isValidRoot` MAX_ROOT_AGE + always-valid-latest | `test_ASupersededCleanRootExpires`, `test_LatestRootIsAlwaysValidHoweverOld` |
| zero predicate = revoke-into-clean | rejected in `revoke` AND at deploy | `test_RevokeRejectsAZeroPredicate`, `test_ConstructorRejectsAZeroPredicate` |
| `remove` = censorship by erasure | never called; no external path | `test_ThereIsNoRemovalPath` |
| two writers on one tree | `register` proof-gated, `revoke` controller-only | `test_RevokeRevertsForNonController` |
| duplicate / re-add resets a revocation | `registered` mapping + SMT `KeyAlreadyExists` | `test_RegisterRevertsOnDuplicate`, `test_RevokedCommitmentCannotBeReAdded` |
| unreadable envelope = unrevocable identity | controller key pinned as immutable | `test_RegisterRevertsOnAForeignControllerKey` |

**`test_ConstructorRejectsAZeroPredicate` needed try/catch**, not `vm.expectRevert` - forge does not
reliably match a revert raised inside CREATE, and reports "did not revert" even when the guard is
working. Same trap hit earlier this project; noted so the next CREATE-guard test does not rediscover it.

**Integration verified end-to-end, not argued:** on-chain `add(key, 0)` produces EXACTLY the root the
Noir gadget computes (`test_ZeroValueLeafMatchesTheCircuitRoot`), a zero-valued leaf is
distinguishable from an empty tree, and revocation's `update` (0 -> predicate) yields the expected
leaf hash.

**STILL TO DO for the 43%:** the `withdraw_identity` circuit rewrite itself (one SMT inclusion, no
`sk_identity`), regenerated fixtures + verifier, `ProofLib`/`PrivacyPool`/`IState` public-input
changes (9 -> 7), and the wallet. The contract half is what landed here.

### 2.13o REVERTED: the JS sparse Merkle tree. ASK THE CONTRACT (user, 2026-07-28)

I hit the merge's blocker - no TS/JS SparseMerkleTree exists in this repo - by ADDING one
(`@zk-kit/smt` + `postman/identityTree.ts`), then wrote a three-way validation
(`tools/check-identity-tree.js`) against circomlibjs, solarity and the Noir gadget to manage the
divergence risk. All 8 checks passed. **All of it is removed.**

**`revocation.ts` had already decided this, in a header I did not read before writing the mirror:**

> NO LOCAL TREE MIRROR, DELIBERATELY. stateTree.ts and identityAsp.ts both rebuild their trees
> off-chain because those are LeanIMTs whose contracts expose only a root - a membership path cannot
> be read out of contract storage, so the wallet has no choice. The revocation registry is
> different: it is a `@solarity` SparseMerkleTree, and `getProof(key)` is a VIEW FUNCTION that
> returns the whole witness. Rebuilding it locally would mean writing a second implementation of a
> sparse trie and keeping it byte-compatible forever, for no benefit. Asking the contract is both
> less code and IMPOSSIBLE TO DRIFT.

The validation passing did not make the mirror worth keeping - it was managing a risk that asking
the contract does not have. `getProof` is a view function on the identity registry too.

**`pp/identityProof.ts` replaces `pp/revocation.ts`**, fetching the INCLUSION witness from
`IdentityRegistry.getProof` and distinguishing each failure where the diagnostic still exists: not
registered (post the escrow envelope first), REVOKED under a named predicate, tree/mapping
disagreement (a contract bug), path deeper than the circuit. `withdrawWitness.ts` now takes that
witness plus `revocationSecret` and drops `skIdentity`/`aspTree` entirely - the assembler's 17
emitted input names match the circuit's parameters exactly.

**Consequence for fixtures:** the generator cannot build the tree in JS either, so it must obtain
the witness the same way - from a deployed registry. A forge script that deploys IdentityRegistry,
registers, calls `getProof` and writes the witness is the remaining piece, and it makes the fixture
provably consistent with the real contract rather than with a second implementation of it.

### 2.13p Fixtures come FROM THE CONTRACT, and the bootstrap order that forces

Following §2.13o's rule (never rebuild the SMT off-chain), the withdrawal fixture's identity witness
cannot be built in JS either. It is emitted by a forge test that drives the REAL registry:
`IdentityRegistry.t.sol::test_EmitIdentityWitnessFixture` registers three identities, calls
`getProof`, and writes `test/fixtures/identity_witness.json`. Generating it inside the suite means it
CANNOT go stale against the contract - a witness built off-chain would only ever prove that two of
our own implementations agree.

**THREE registrations, not one, and there is no shortcut.** A single-leaf SMT has an EMPTY inclusion
path, so a withdrawal built on it would hash NO SIBLINGS and prove nothing about the Merkle path -
the same degeneracy `tools/build-withdrawal-fixture.js` already refuses to emit for the state tree.
The registry admits a commitment ONLY via `register`, which requires a genuine escrow proof; adding
a privileged insert to seed the tree would be exactly the mock this project forbids. So
`tools/build-escrow-fixtures.js` emits three distinct witnesses and all three are proved with bb and
committed (`escrow_envelope{0,1,2}.proof/.public`, all verified).

**A BUG IN MY OWN GENERATOR, caught before it cost anything.** The first run produced three
identities sharing ONE `dg1Hash`: the MRZ varied the passport number via
`String(1234567890 + i).slice(0, 9)`, which truncated the very digit being varied. Because a
document hash may bind to exactly one holder (§2.13f), identities 1 and 2 would have failed to
register with a `DocumentBoundToAnotherHolder` revert far from the cause. Fixed to a nine-digit
number that survives the slice; all three hashes now differ, and `escrow0` still reproduces the
previously committed fixture exactly.

**THE BOOTSTRAP ORDER, because it is circular and not obvious:**
1. escrow witnesses -> bb proofs -> committed (DONE)
2. pool test suites must COMPILE, or the emitter test cannot run at all (3 files: constructor arity
   for the single registry, `pubSignals` 9 -> 7, `ASP_REGISTRY` -> `IDENTITY_REGISTRY`)
3. run the emitter -> `identity_witness.json`
4. `tools/build-withdrawal-fixture.js` consumes it -> withdrawal witness -> bb proof
5. regenerate the withdrawal verifier (7 public inputs) and re-run everything

Steps 2-5 are the remainder. `main` stays green throughout; all of this is on
`wip/identity-tree-merge`.

### 2.13q Rewiring the pool suites: TWO bugs caught that would have shipped silently

Bootstrap step 2 (§2.13p). `PrivacyPoolSimple`/`PrivacyPoolComplex` now build against the single
registry. Both defects below would have COMPILED AND PASSED.

**BUG 1 - the registry was built at the wrong depth.** `IdentityRegistry.t.sol` constructed the tree
with `treeHeight_ = 20` while the circuit is fixed at `IDENTITY_TREE_DEPTH = 32`. Solarity's
`maxDepth` is a CAP, so the ROOT is identical either way and every existing test still passed - which
is exactly why it would have survived. It bites later: a depth-20 registry rejects a deep insert the
depth-32 circuit accepts, and a witness longer than the circuit's fixed sibling array cannot be
padded into one. Now a named constant with the agreement spelled out.

**BUG 2 - a test that would have stopped testing anything.** `MockEntrypoint.isValidRoot` returned
`true` UNCONDITIONALLY. That was sound while it only stood in for the REVOCATION registry: the ASP
root was checked separately through `isKnownAspRoot`, which did honour its `known` mapping, so the
identity gate was still exercised. Under the single tree `isValidRoot` IS the only identity gate, so
an unconditional `true` would have made `test_withdraw_revertsOnInvalidIdentityRoot` pass while
asserting NOTHING. Now honours `known` and rejects the zero root, matching the real registry.

**Slot renumbering, done by reading each site rather than pattern-replacing** - the shift is not
uniform, because a slot was REMOVED from the middle:

| old | new | |
|---|---|---|
| [5] asp_root | [5] identityRoot | same slot, different registry |
| [6] asp_tree_depth | - | gone with the LeanIMT identity tree |
| [7] context | [6] context | **moved** |
| [8] revocation_root | - | merged into [5] |

A blind `[7] -> [6]` would have been wrong for the tests perturbing `[5]`, and a blind shift-by-one
wrong for `[3]`/`[4]`. Every site was read.

**Remaining:** `WithdrawEndToEnd` (18 references to the two old registries) and
`WithdrawalHonkVerifier` both need the REGENERATED withdrawal fixture, which needs the emitter to
run, which needs those files to compile - the circular step from §2.13p. That is the next piece, and
it is deliberately not being rushed: those two suites are the primary guard on the withdrawal path.

### 2.13r INVISIBLE-BUG AUDIT (user: "search for any more invisible bugs like this")

Hunting the CLASSES of the two defects in §2.13q - a mock that silently stops asserting, and a
constant that disagrees across a boundary while every test still passes.

**FOUND AND FIXED - the escrow digest had NO independent check.**
`IdentityRegistry.register` requires `holderOfDocumentHash(dg1_hash) == holder_root`, so the escrow's
`dg1_hash` must equal the one REGISTRATION produced. Nothing verified that: `IdentityRegistry.t.sol`
plants the document using the ESCROW'S OWN `dg1Hash`, so the two could have disagreed - about the
DG1 length, the digest algorithm, or the byte packing - and every test would still have passed while
NO REAL DOCUMENT COULD EVER BE ESCROWED.

I nearly "fixed" it the wrong way. `escrow_envelope` uses `DG1_LEN = 95` while `register_identity`
takes 93, which looked like a straightforward mismatch. It is not: 95 is the ICAO TD1 layout that
`register_identity_light_td1` takes, and the LIGHT circuit is the one actually verified -
`RegistrationSimple._PROOF_SIGNALS_COUNT` is 3, the light circuit's output arity, where the full
`register_identity` returns 5. So 95 is CORRECT, my comment calling it "TD3 (passport)" was wrong,
and changing it to 93 would have BROKEN the working path.
`escrow_envelope::test_dg1_hash_matches_the_registration_circuit` now compares against
`register_identity_light`'s OWN returned value - the only reference that cannot drift with that file.
It passes.

**CHECKED AND CLEAN - constants that must agree across boundaries:**

| constant | contract | circuit | wallet |
|---|---|---|---|
| state tree depth | `State.MAX_TREE_DEPTH` 32 | `state_siblings [Field; 32]` | `stateTree.ts` 32 |
| identity tree depth | `IdentityRegistry.t.sol` 32 | `IDENTITY_TREE_DEPTH` 32 | `identityProof.ts` 32 |
| escrow public inputs | `PUBLIC_INPUT_COUNT` 12 | 12 | codegen target 12 |

**FOUND - dead inheritance in live contract code.** `Entrypoint` inherits AND initializes
`EIP712Upgradeable`, with an init comment describing `admitIdentityWithAuthorization` - a function
that no longer exists there (it moved to IdentityAspRegistry in §2.5a). There is no
`_hashTypedDataV4`, no typehash and no signature recovery anywhere in the contract. Costs bytecode
and misleads about what the contract does. Removal is layout-safe under OZ 5's ERC-7201 namespaced
storage, but it is an inheritance change to an UPGRADEABLE contract, so it belongs in the merge's
deletion pass rather than being slipped in mid-rewire.

**FOUND - `MinimalEntrypoint.isKnownAspRoot`** in PrivacyPoolComplex.t.sol is now unreachable: the
pool no longer calls it. Its sibling `isValidRoot` returning an unconditional `true` is FINE there,
unlike the Simple case in §2.13q, because that suite has no withdraw tests at all - checked, not
assumed.

**ORPHANED BY THE MERGE, to delete once WithdrawEndToEnd is rewired:** `IdentityAspRegistry` +
`IIdentityAspRegistry` + its test, `RevocationRegistry` + `IRevocationRegistry` + its test, and the
wallet's `postman/identityAsp.ts`. Listing them now so the deletion is deliberate rather than
discovered later by a dead-symbol scan.

### 2.13s SETTLED: Entrypoint no longer inherits EIP712Upgradeable (user, 2026-07-28)

*"if you are using none of it dont inherit it"*. `Entrypoint` inherited AND initialized
`EIP712Upgradeable` while containing no `_hashTypedDataV4`, no typehash and no signature recovery -
left over from when `admitIdentityWithAuthorization` lived there, before §2.5a moved it to
IdentityAspRegistry. The init comment still described that function.

**Storage safety VERIFIED, not argued.** Removing an inherited contract from an UPGRADEABLE
contract is the one way this could go badly, so it was checked with `forge inspect Entrypoint
storage-layout` before and after:

    before: scopeToPool@0, assetConfig@1, usedPrecommitments@2, EVIDENCE_REGISTRY@3
    after:  scopeToPool@0, assetConfig@1, usedPrecommitments@2, EVIDENCE_REGISTRY@3

BYTE-IDENTICAL, because OZ 5 puts EIP712's state in an ERC-7201 NAMESPACED slot
(`EIP712StorageLocation = 0xa16a46d9...`) rather than in the sequential layout. Had it used
sequential storage, this removal would have shifted every variable after it and silently corrupted a
deployed proxy - which is precisely why it was measured rather than reasoned about.

Also removed `MinimalEntrypoint.isKnownAspRoot` (PrivacyPoolComplex.t.sol), unreachable since the
pool stopped calling it. Its sibling `isValidRoot` returning unconditional `true` is documented as
deliberate there: that suite has no withdraw tests, so the identity gate is never under test - the
opposite of the Simple case in §2.13q, which did need to honour its `known` mapping.

### 2.14 legalDescriptionHash IS A DE-ANONYMISATION VECTOR (user, 2026-07-28) - NOT BUILT

`TitleLedger.sol:56` carries `bytes32 legalDescriptionHash` - a plain, UNSALTED hash of the
off-chain legal description. Two separate problems, and the second was never surfaced anywhere in
this fusion's docs.

**1. It is an unimplemented integration point, not merely a simplified one.** A grep across
`title_holder.nr`, `title_holder/src/main.nr`, the whole `identity-wallet/src/` tree and `tools/`
finds NOTHING that computes this hash. Verified: no wallet-side and no circuit-side producer exists.
The contract stores a value nothing in this system knows how to make.

**2. THE REAL GAP - it is a privacy leak by construction, independent of the missing
implementation.** Legal descriptions of real property (street address, parcel/APN, plat description)
are frequently LOW-ENTROPY AND PUBLICLY ENUMERABLE - county assessor records are often public and
searchable. Anyone asking "is property X tokenised, and under which titleId?" can pull candidate
descriptions from public records, hash each one exactly as the contract does, and compare against
every on-chain `legalDescriptionHash`. A match reveals WHICH REAL-WORLD PROPERTY sits behind a given
titleId. It does not reveal who holds it - `holderCommitment` covers that - but "which properties
are in the system" is disclosed to anyone willing to run a dictionary.

**The existing test demonstrates the vector rather than guarding against it:**
`TitleLedger.t.sol:177` asserts `entry.legalDescriptionHash == keccak256('42 Khreshchatyk St,
Kyiv')` - a bare keccak of a street address, precisely the enumerable input that makes this
brute-forceable.

**The fix is a pattern this codebase ALREADY RUNS IN PRODUCTION** - Privacy Pool's precommitment
scheme (`frontend/identity-wallet/src/pp/notes.ts`). Commit to the document together with a random,
high-entropy, holder-held salt - `Poseidon(legal_description_hash, salt)` - instead of hashing the
document alone. The commitment stays binding and Ricardian: present the document plus the salt and
anyone can verify it matches on-chain, which is the property the design wants. But it becomes
computationally infeasible to brute-force from public records, because the salt supplies the entropy
the legal description lacks. The salt is disclosed only when opening is actually required - a
dispute, a loan default, a transfer needing proof of the underlying document - not by default. This
is NOT a new primitive for this system; it is the same commit-reveal shape already used for PP
deposits, applied to a field that currently has none of it.

**Real work if pursued:**
1. Decide the threat model FIRST - must "which property" stay hidden, or only "who holds it"? The
   answer changes whether this is a defect or an accepted disclosure.
2. If yes: add the salt to `mintTitle`'s commitment, and to whatever wallet/notary tooling
   eventually computes it - which does not exist yet, see (1) above.
3. Define the reveal/verification flow for the cases that genuinely need the commitment opened.

Interacts with §2.13l: if titles become documents and notaries become registered identities, this
commitment should be settled in the same pass rather than bolted on afterwards.

### 2.13t MERGE: the circular bootstrap is BROKEN, and the withdrawal proves on-chain at 7 signals

268/269 forge tests. The withdrawal circuit, both its fixtures, the verifier, ProofLib, PrivacyPool
and four test suites are all on the single identity tree.

**THE LOOP IS CLOSED, contract to circuit.** `IdentityRegistry` registers three identities through
real escrow proofs, `getProof` emits root + siblings, and the Noir circuit's `smt_verifier_full`
ACCEPTS them as an inclusion of `commitment -> 0`. Verified by `nargo execute` against the emitted
witness, then proved and verified with bb, then verified ON-CHAIN by the regenerated verifier
(`WithdrawalHonkVerifier.t.sol`, 11/11, both the hand-vector and wallet-derived fixtures).

**Withdrawal is 24,812 ACIR opcodes, down from 43,772 (-43%)** - the projection, confirmed on the
real circuit rather than a scratch model.

**Test constants were patched FROM THE PROOF FILES, never transcribed.** Fourteen 77-digit values by
hand is where this would have rotted; a wrong constant fails as `SumcheckFailed` with nothing
pointing at the transcription.

**Four incidental defects fixed on the way, each of which would have failed confusingly later:**
- `tools/build-withdrawal-fixture.js`'s documented `tsc` invocation was missing `--rootDir src`.
  With one input file tsc infers the root as `src/pp` and emits a FLAT build, so the `pp/` prefix the
  script requires disappears. It was implicit only while two files from different directories were
  compiled together.
- The same header pointed the build at `tools/build`, which cannot resolve `@iden3/js-crypto` - node
  walks UP for `node_modules` and there is none above `tools/`. It must sit inside the wallet.
- `WithdrawEndToEnd`'s new mock proxies used empty init data, which OZ 5.6.1 rejects; the other
  suites already carry an `UnsafeTestProxy` for exactly this.
- `test_FixturesAreNotDegenerate` could no longer see the identity path, since it is now PRIVATE.
  The check MOVED (registry `getProof` siblings, asserted in WithdrawEndToEnd and in the emitter)
  rather than being dropped - recorded in the test itself, because a silently narrower degeneracy
  check is the exact failure that function exists to prevent.

**REMAINING: `tools/build-e2e-fixture.js` DOES NOT EXIST.** `WithdrawEndToEnd`'s header has always
pointed at it, and it is not in the repo - so `Prover.e2e.toml` has never been reproducible from a
committed script. Its 9 tests fail only because the fixture is stale: adding the state keeper and
registry deployments moved the pool's address, hence `SCOPE`, hence every label, commitment and
context derived from it. That staleness is exactly what `test_ScopeMatchesFixture` exists to catch,
and it caught it. Writing that generator - as a mode of `build-withdrawal-fixture.js` rather than a
second script - is the last step, and it closes a reproducibility hole that predates this work.

### 2.13u MERGE COMPLETE: 281/281, and the missing e2e generator now exists

The single identity tree is live end to end. 281 forge tests, 84 pp tests, 1 escrow circuit test,
tsc clean, client ABI check clean, all four verifiers inside EIP-170.

**`tools/build-e2e-fixture.js` NOW EXISTS.** `WithdrawEndToEnd.t.sol` had named it as its fixture
provenance since the commit that introduced the test - and it was never written. Checked properly
before writing it: absent from this repo's entire history (58 commits, root
`0762975 Fork rarime + Privacy Pools...`), and it CANNOT exist upstream either, because
`withdraw_identity` is this fork's own Noir circuit while upstream Privacy Pools is Circom/Groth16
with no `Prover.toml` at all. So `Prover.e2e.toml` had never been reproducible from anything
committed. It is now, including a `--ragequit` mode for the second e2e fixture, which had the same
gap.

**The regeneration cascade, and why so much moved.** Adding the state keeper and registry
deployments to setUp moved the pool's ADDRESS, hence `SCOPE`, hence every label, precommitment,
commitment and context derived from it. `test_ScopeMatchesFixture` caught it immediately, which is
what it exists for. Regenerated in order: precommitments -> deposits -> state root -> withdrawal
witness -> proof, then the ragequit note the same way.

**A defect the generator's own cross-check caught.** The first draft reconstructed only OUR leaf and
padded the other three with a placeholder - but a LeanIMT root depends on EVERY leaf, so the root
would have been wrong. The `state_root disagrees with the chain` assertion fired immediately. Fixed
by deriving all four labels from the pool's own rule (`keccak256(SCOPE, nonce) % FIELD`, nonce from
1), which reproduces the chain's root exactly. Without that cross-check the failure would have
surfaced as an unexplained proof rejection.

**Every constant in both suites was patched FROM THE PROOF FILES, never transcribed** - twenty-odd
77-digit values, where a single typo fails as `SumcheckFailed` with nothing pointing at the cause.

Withdrawal: **24,812 ACIR opcodes, down from 43,772 (-43%)**, proving on-chain at 7 public inputs
against a root produced by the real registry from three genuine escrow registrations.

### 2.13v DELETION PASS - and it found a REGRESSION I had introduced

Seven files removed: `IdentityAspRegistry.sol`, `RevocationRegistry.sol`, both their interfaces,
both their test suites, and the wallet's `postman/identityAsp.ts`. All superseded by the single
identity tree. 255/255 forge, tsc clean, client ABI check clean.

**COVERAGE WAS MAPPED CASE BY CASE BEFORE DELETING, NOT ASSUMED.** Comparing
`RevocationRegistry.t.sol`'s 13 tests against `IdentityRegistry.t.sol`'s showed seven already had
equivalents (CannotRevokeTwice -> RevokeIsMonotone, StrangerCannotRevoke ->
RevokeRevertsForNonController, StaleRootStopsBeingValid -> ASupersededCleanRootExpires,
RootThatNeverExisted -> UnknownRootIsRejected, UnknownPredicateIsUncitable ->
RevokeRejectsAnUnknownPredicate, NoRemove -> ThereIsNoRemovalPath, LatestRootNeverExpires ->
LatestRootIsAlwaysValidHoweverOld). **Six did not, and were ported.** Deleting the file without them
would have silently narrowed coverage.

**THE REGRESSION.** `RevocationRegistry` REJECTED duplicate predicates at deploy;
**`IdentityRegistry` did not** - I never carried that guard across. A duplicate passes silently,
because `isPredicate` is idempotent, while pushing the same value twice into `_predicates`, so the
published set misreports itself. It is deploy-time-only and immutable, so there is no correcting it
afterwards. Guard added, and `test_ConstructorRejectsDuplicatePredicates` VERIFIED to fail without
it. Found ONLY because the deletion was done by mapping coverage rather than by checking that the
build still passed.

*(To be clear about the name: a PREDICATE is a REASON for revocation - `keccak256('OFAC_SDN')`,
`keccak256('DOC_INVALID')` - fixed in a closed set at deploy. Nothing to do with duplicate
IDENTITIES, which are a separate guard: `registered[commitment]` plus the SMT's own
`KeyAlreadyExists`, both already tested.)*

**Also ported:** empty predicate set, all three zero-address cases, the leaf VALUE actually
recording the predicate (auditable from committed state, not just the event log), revoking moving
the root, and the absence of any governance selector.

**`DeployLib`'s salts named deleted contracts** - live code, not comments. Replaced with
`IDENTITY_REGISTRY_SALT` and `ESCROW_VERIFIER_SALT`; the pairwise-distinctness test still covers all
eight. Comments that asserted the deleted contracts still exist were corrected; comments that
reference them as HISTORY were left, since they record why a guard exists.

**The ABI checker earned its keep again**: after deletion it reported `@contract IdentityRegistry is
AMBIGUOUS - 2 artifacts`, a stale artifact from the moved source. `forge clean && forge build`, as
its own message suggests, cleared it. That ambiguity guard was added precisely so a moved contract
could not silently resolve against an old ABI.

### 2.13w A SECOND REGRESSION, and the process gap that hid it (user, 2026-07-29)

*"deal with all of these regressions and duplicates, act on your justification"*.

**THE PROCESS GAP FIRST, because it is the reusable lesson.** I mapped `RevocationRegistry.t.sol`'s
coverage test by test before deleting it - and then deleted `IdentityAspRegistry.t.sol` in the SAME
commit without doing that at all. Same deletion, same risk, one file checked and one not. Recovering
the deleted file from git and mapping its 19 tests found what the build could not.

**REGRESSION: ERC-7812 EVIDENCE ANCHORING WAS SILENTLY DROPPED.** `IdentityAspRegistry` anchored
EVERY root as an evidence statement (`EVIDENCE_REGISTRY.addStatement`). `IdentityRegistry` had no
evidence registry at all - I never carried it across, and nothing failed, because anchoring is a
side effect no other test observed. Anchoring is what makes a root EXTERNALLY ATTESTABLE rather than
merely stored: another contract, or another chain, can verify a root existed without trusting this
contract's own getters. Every other root in this fusion is published that way, so the identity tree
had become the silent exception.

RESTORED, with a correction the old design would have got wrong here: the statement key is keyed on
a monotone `rootSequence`, NOT on tree size. A REVOCATION moves the root WITHOUT adding a leaf, so a
size-derived key would collide on the second anchor - and `TestEvidenceRegistry` reverts on a
duplicate key, so it would have taken the whole revocation transaction with it.

**Also restored:** the zero-commitment and out-of-field leaf checks. The commitment comes from a
verified proof binding it to a Poseidon output, so neither is reachable - but the previous registry
checked its leaves, and dropping the check leaves that reasoning implicit in a contract that cannot
be upgraded to add it back.

Four tests added, covering both writers: registration anchors, REVOCATION anchors, each root gets a
distinct statement key, and a zero evidence registry is refused at deploy.

### 2.13x Acting on the justification: two entry points, one library

I justified writing `tools/build-e2e-fixture.js` as a separate script - correctly, since
`WithdrawEndToEnd.t.sol` names that exact path and folding it into the other generator as a flag
would leave the reference pointing at nothing. But I then left the two scripts carrying the same
mnemonic, the same escrow secret, the same identity-witness loader with its degeneracy check, the
same wallet-module loader and the same TOML writer. A change to any of them had to be made twice or
silently drift.

`tools/lib/fixture-common.js` now holds all of it. The entry points stay separate; the logic does
not.

**VERIFIED BEHAVIOUR-PRESERVING, not assumed:** all four generated witnesses - baseline, wallet, e2e
withdrawal and e2e ragequit - are BYTE-IDENTICAL after the refactor (`git diff` empty on every
Prover.toml). A refactor of fixture generators is exactly where a silent change would go unnoticed,
since the fixtures are only read by proofs that would then fail somewhere else entirely.

### 2.14a IMPLEMENTED - and the original write-up missed the bigger leak sitting next to it

§2.14's fix is built: `legalDescriptionHash` becomes `legalDescriptionCommitment`, a SALTED
`Poseidon(hash, salt)`, plus `verifyLegalDescription(titleId, hash, salt)` for the Ricardian open.
Without that view the salt would make the commitment merely unreadable rather than
confidential-but-provable. 259 forge tests, ABI check clean.

**THE GAP IN THE ORIGINAL ANALYSIS: `legalDescriptionURI`.** §2.14 identified the bare hash as
brute-forceable from public county records and proposed a salt - correct, and incomplete. The struct
carries a PUBLIC `string legalDescriptionURI` right beside it, and the existing test filled it with
`'ipfs://legal-doc'`. **If that URI resolves to the document, the salt buys nothing** - an observer
skips the dictionary attack and simply fetches it. Fixing the hash while its neighbour links
straight to the plaintext would have produced confidence without confidentiality.

Handled by DOCUMENTING the field's effect and leaving it optional rather than forcing it empty: a
deployment that genuinely wants public property records is legitimate, and this contract should not
decide that. But it must now be a DECISION, not an accident. The test suite leaves it empty and says
why.

**Tests assert the vector is closed, not merely that the code runs:** the stored value is NOT the
bare document hash (the dictionary attack); the true document plus salt DOES open it on-chain; a
wrong salt or wrong document does not; and the same document under two salts gives two commitments,
so two titles over one property are not linkable to each other even while the property stays hidden.

**Still open, and it is the policy question §2.14 flagged first:** whether "which property" must
stay hidden at all. The mechanism now supports either answer - empty URI for confidential, populated
for public - where before it silently supported only the leaky one.

### 2.14b SALT REPLACED - it bought confidentiality by DESTROYING uniqueness (user, 2026-07-29)

*"forget salts and use the better primitive"*. Correct, and the salt was worse than merely
suboptimal.

**WHAT THE SALT BROKE.** Nothing in `TitleLedger` prevented two titles over the SAME property -
verified, not assumed. A bare hash at least COLLIDES, so a duplicate is detectable. A per-holder
salt makes two titles over one parcel produce two unrelated values, so **DOUBLE-MINTING BECOMES
INVISIBLE**. I had even written `test_theSameDocumentUnderDifferentSaltsIsUnlinkable` celebrating
that as a privacy win; for a title registry it is a hole. The salt traded away the one property a
land register cannot do without.

**THE REPLACEMENT: a DETERMINISTIC KEYED PSEUDONYM**, `propertyKey = PRF(registryKey, docHash)`,
computed off-chain by the notary. DETERMINISTIC, so a second title over the same property collides
and is rejected. OPAQUE without the key, so the public cannot run a dictionary against county
records. And it adds NO new trust: the notary already knows the document - they attest to it - so
holding the key grants them nothing they did not have.

**The same primitive as the identity registry's revocation pseudonyms (§2.13e)** - a public set of
opaque deterministic values - now serving two subsystems instead of one.

It also removes the salt's CUSTODY failure, which would have been the worse operational bug: a lost
salt makes a commitment permanently unopenable, and for a real property title that is unrecoverable.
There is no per-title secret here to lose.

**THE UNIQUENESS INVARIANT, which never existed before:** `titleOfProperty` maps a property to its
one live title. A second mint reverts unless it is a genuine SUCCESSION citing the title it replaces
- without that branch every legitimate reissue and transfer would be blocked - and a successor may
not cite a prior title over a DIFFERENT property, which would launder one property's chain of title
into another's.

**`legalDescriptionURI` IS GONE.** §2.14a documented it as a decision the deployer must make; that
was too weak. Its only role was pointing at the document, publicly. Under this design the document
is never opened on-chain at all - binding is the notary's signature over `propertyKey` - so a public
pointer buys nothing and costs everything. Removing it also resolved a `Stack too deep` that the new
check triggered, which is the compiler agreeing the field was surplus.

**The invariant immediately caught a test minting two titles over one property**
(`test_verifyHolderProof_rejectsAProofBoundToAnotherTitle`), which now uses two properties.

### 2.15 SPEC.PDF (Cryptographic Mortgage Protocol v2.0) - what it corrects and what it adds

Read 2026-07-29. Corrects a design decision I made without it, and opens scope not previously recorded.

**CORRECTION - THE NOTARY COMPUTES NOTHING.** §2.14b had the notary computing
`propertyKey = PRF(registryKey, docHash)` off-chain. Wrong. Per §3 of the spec, a notary is A REGULAR
USER; their notary status is established by TLSNOTARY PROOFS (2PC MPC-TLS) over WebPKI TLS sessions
from `portal.notary.ir`, verified on-chain in `NotaryRegistry.sol`, with headless scrapers indexing
office number, name and licence status. Explicitly NO third-party aggregator (no Reclaim). So the
notary holds no protocol key and performs no protocol computation - they are attested, not trusted
with secrets. `TitleLedger`'s current `bindNotaryAddress` placeholder is superseded by this.

**THE SPEC'S OWN NULLIFIER HAS THE TENSION I FOUND IN §2.14b.** §4.1 defines
`N = PoseidonHash(Cadastral_ID, Secret_Salt)`, described as "deterministic, un-linkable" and used to
prevent double-mortgaging. Those two properties pull against each other exactly as §2.14b found:
a per-borrower secret salt makes N un-linkable but ALSO makes two liens on one parcel look
unrelated, defeating the double-mortgage check; a shared salt makes N deterministic but
brute-forceable, since *Shenaseh Yekta* is an 18-digit enumerable key. UNRESOLVED IN THE SPEC.
Resolving it is the same problem `propertyKey` faces and should be settled once, for both.

**NEW SCOPE, none of it previously recorded:**
- `LandRegistry.sol` - parcel nullifiers, lien registration/discharge, `verifyParcelNullifier`.
- `MortgageEngine.sol` - loan lifecycle (ACTIVE/DELINQUENT/IN_DEFAULT/PAID_OFF), monthly payments,
  default enforcement at day 91, LTV <= 70% and DTI <= 43% underwriting, algorithmic rates on pool
  utilisation.
- Two capital models: sovereign treasury (7% APY RWA, 200-300bps subsidy) vs private LP vaults.
- Tiered cadastral access (§2.2): Tier 2 - general public/lenders - can verify deed authenticity
  from the 18-digit ID plus the owner's National ID. That is the verification path a lender uses,
  and it is PUBLIC, which constrains how much the parcel nullifier can hide.
- Default bridge: threshold encryption is OPTIONAL. Option A is a 2-of-3 legal multisig / notarised
  escrow of an irrevocable power of attorney; Option B is k-of-n threshold ElGamal.

**GENERALISATION (user, 2026-07-29):** this work must not be Iran-specific. The identity, title and
lien machinery is jurisdiction-agnostic; only the registry endpoints, the deed schema and the
enforcement vendors are local. Keep them behind an interface so a second jurisdiction is a
configuration, not a fork. `iran-constitutional-monarchy` is OUT OF SCOPE for now.

### 2.15a CRE INSTEAD OF TLSNotary, with a controller-published workflow version (user, 2026-07-29)

The spec (§2.15) specifies TLSNotary 2PC MPC-TLS over `portal.notary.ir`. **We already have the
property that buys, by a cheaper route.** `backend/cre/notary_registry/main.go` exists and does
exactly this job for Ukraine's Ministry of Justice registry: cron-triggered scrape, then
`cre.ConsensusIdenticalAggregation` requires EVERY DON node to independently fetch and produce a
BYTE-IDENTICAL result before a report is generated. That is what makes it an anchored external
authority rather than one operator's assertion - the same reason TLSNotary is specified, without the
MPC-TLS machinery.

**THE PROBLEM CRE HAS AND TLSNotary DOES NOT: scrapers rot.** A government portal changes its HTML
and the workflow silently starts producing nothing, or worse, produces a consensus-valid parse of
the wrong fields. TLSNotary proves the SESSION, so a format change breaks the parse in the prover;
CRE proves the CONSENSUS, so a format change breaks it identically on every node and consensus is
still reached on a wrong answer.

**USER'S PROPOSAL: the SAME controller that writes the label and blacklist lists also publishes
which CRE workflow version is current**, so the scraper can be updated when a portal changes.

That is the right shape - one authority, already trusted for exactly this class of decision, rather
than a second one - but it needs the trust caveat stated: **a controller that can point at a new
workflow can point at a MALICIOUS one**, and the DON would faithfully reach consensus on its output.
CRE's consensus protects against a rogue NODE, not against a rogue WORKFLOW.

Mitigations to design in, not assume:
- A workflow is compiled wasm with a deterministic ID, so a pointer names a SPECIFIC, auditable
  artifact - not "whatever the controller runs".
- Version history APPEND-ONLY, so a swap is permanently visible rather than a silent substitution.
- A TIMELOCK between publishing a version and it taking effect, so a swap can be seen and contested
  BEFORE it is load-bearing. Without this the update mechanism is a same-block censorship lever.
- The existing fail-open rule still applies: if no valid workflow is published, the last good
  anchored data stays valid rather than everything halting.

**NOT YET BUILT.** Recorded now because it changes §2.15's stated approach and because the timelock
is the kind of thing that is hard to add after a mechanism is depended upon.

### 2.13l-DONE A notary is a REGISTERED IDENTITY, and therefore revocable

Closes the structural half of §2.13l, informed by §2.15's correction that a notary is a regular user
whose status comes from CRE attestation rather than from holding any protocol key. 267 forge tests.

**THE DEFECT.** `address notary` plus `notaryDataHash[address]`, bound by the registry postman.
`TitleLedger`'s own header already called this an OPEN GAP - "this address really is that notary"
was asserted, not proven. Worse than unproven: **an address has no passport to expire, no document
to invalidate and no status to lose, so a notary was the ONLY participant in this system who could
not be revoked.**

**NOW: keyed by `holderRoot`.** Two independent facts, deliberately kept apart because they fail
independently:
- `notaryDataHashOf[holderRoot]` - WHICH registry entry the identity claims, proven against the
  CRE-anchored active snapshot. Notary-ness comes from the official register.
- `notaryIdentityOf[signingKey]` - which key acts for that identity, so an action needs no fresh
  zero-knowledge proof per signature.

`_requireActiveNotary` now checks THREE things: the key is bound; the identity **still holds a
current document**; and the registry entry is in the active snapshot. Losing notary status and
losing identity status are different events, so collapsing them into one flag somebody must remember
to clear would be the bug.

**DELIBERATELY NOT KEYED ON THE POOL COMMITMENT**, which is this system's other identity handle and
would have made the revocation check trivial. That value is a notary's PRIVATE key into the shielded
pool; publishing it to gain revocability would link their public professional role to their private
financial identity - buying one property by destroying the one the pool exists to provide.
`holderRoot` is already public in registration events, so it costs nothing.

**THE REMAINING GAP, narrowed and still stated.** Binding is still postman-gated: "this holderRoot
really is that notary" is asserted. It is now much narrower - the subject is a real, registered,
revocable identity rather than an anonymous keypair, and the registry entry itself is CRE-attested -
but closing it fully needs the notary to prove control of `holderRoot` at bind time, which needs a
circuit that does not exist yet.

**Tests:** a notary whose document is revoked stops being able to act; binding refuses an identity
with no current document; and a VALID identity whose registry entry is absent from the snapshot is a
valid person but not a valid notary - the two checks failing separately, as designed.

### 2.13l-B The notary binding is PROOF-GATED - no new circuit was needed (user, 2026-07-29)

*"are you sure we need the circuit that doesnt exist yet?"* - no, and the challenge was right.

I claimed closing the notary-binding gap needed a circuit proving control of `holder_root` at bind
time. **`pp::title_holder` already does exactly that.** It proves
`holder_root == extract_pk_identity_hash(sk_identity)` and binds it to a SECOND FIELD - and that
field is an arbitrary CONTEXT. It is named `title_id` only because that was its first use. Its
verifier is already deployed and wired into TitleLedger, and PoseidonUnit2L is already available
on-chain, so the whole thing was a call away.

`bindNotaryIdentity` now requires that proof, against a context binding BOTH the signing key and the
register entry, so a proof obtained for one binding cannot be replayed to attach a different key or
a different notary.

**WHAT THIS CLOSES:** the postman can no longer fabricate a binding for an identity whose owner never
consented. Previously it could name any holderRoot at all.

**WHAT REMAINS, and it is a materially smaller claim:** the postman still chooses WHICH register
entry is attached. Proving the entry is genuinely this person's needs the register's name and office
number matched against the passport's own DG1 name field - a comparison no circuit here performs.
So the residual trust is "the postman attached the right entry", not "the postman invented a notary".

**THE LESSON:** I reached for a new circuit before checking what the existing ones actually prove.
The generality was in the parameter NAME, not the constraint - `title_id: Field` constrains nothing
about titles.

### 2.16 HOLDING A NOTARY TO ACCOUNT WITHOUT UNMASKING ANYONE (user, 2026-07-29)

*"if they make fraudulent claims someone should be able to prove that and hold it against them in
court - how would this reveal the notary's identity though without defeating the purpose?"*

**IT DOES NOT, BECAUSE A NOTARY'S IDENTITY IS ALREADY PUBLIC BY PROFESSION.** They hold a public
office; their name, office number and licence status are ON THE STATE REGISTER - that register is
precisely what the CRE scraper reads. Attribution therefore discloses only what the state already
publishes.

The evidentiary chain is complete and permanent: the notary's signature over the mint message, bound
to their signing key, bound to their `holderRoot`, bound to their `notaryDataHash`, which IS their
register entry. Non-repudiable, and it names a real person in a real register - which is what a court
needs.

**WHAT STAYS PRIVATE:** which PROPERTY (opaque `propertyKey`) and WHO the holder is
(`holderCommitment`). And the aggrieved party in a notary-fraud case IS the holder, so disclosing the
property is at the VICTIM'S OWN DISCRETION when they bring the case. Nobody else can open it.

**AND THE NOTARY'S PERSONAL FINANCES STAY SEPARATE.** This is where §2.13l's refusal to key the
notary on their pool commitment pays off: professional accountability without exposing their private
financial life. Had we taken the easy revocation check, holding a notary to account for fraud would
have simultaneously deanonymised their own pool activity.

**NO STAKE OR BOND IS NEEDED**, and this is a design conclusion rather than an omission. A notary is
LEGALLY bound - they already hold a licence a court can strip. Requiring them to pledge capital into
the pool would add a slashing mechanism that duplicates a sanction the law already imposes far more
heavily, while making the professional role capital-gated.

**ONE REAL LEAK TO FLAG.** `IdentityRegistry.register` carries BOTH `holder_root` and `commitment` as
public inputs, so they are linkable from calldata. A notary's `holderRoot` becomes public when bound,
which makes their pool COMMITMENT discoverable. Their ACTIVITY stays hidden - a withdrawal never
discloses the commitment, it is a private SMT key - but their PARTICIPATION becomes visible.
Mitigation: a notary should register a SEPARATE identity for their professional role. The system
already supports many identities per person, so this is operational guidance, not new machinery.

### 2.16a CORRECTION: notaries can be TARGETED - anonymous attestation, conditional accountability

§2.16 answered "how do we hold a notary to account without unmasking them" with: a notary's identity
is ALREADY public by profession, so attribution discloses nothing new. **That is wrong under the
threat model that actually matters here** (user, 2026-07-29): notaries can be targeted.

**THE DISTINCTION I MISSED.** It is public that Jane Doe is a notary - her name and office are on the
state register. It must NOT be public that Jane Doe attested titles IN THIS SYSTEM. In a hostile
jurisdiction the second fact is the dangerous one, and the current design publishes it: `holderRoot`
is bound on-chain and every action names the signing key.

**THE FIX, and it needs no new primitives - both already exist here:**

1. **ANONYMOUS SET MEMBERSHIP.** The notary proves in zero knowledge "I am one of the currently
   active notaries" - a Merkle inclusion against the CRE-anchored snapshot - WITHOUT revealing which.
   Exactly the proof shape the identity registry already performs, applied to the notary set.
   `_requireActiveNotary` currently takes a public `address notary_` and a plaintext Merkle proof;
   that becomes a ZK proof over the same root.

2. **CONDITIONAL DEANONYMISATION via the SEALED ENVELOPE we already built.** The attestation carries
   a hashed-ElGamal envelope sealing the notary's identity to a k-of-n legal guardian set, opened
   ONLY on a fraud finding. `pp/src/envelope.nr` does this today for revocation secrets; the
   difference is only what is sealed and who holds the key.

**THIS IS THE SPEC'S OWN PATTERN.** §5 Option B specifies threshold ElGamal with decentralised legal
guardian nodes releasing shares on a default. Same machinery, applied to notary identity rather than
the power of attorney - so it is one mechanism serving two purposes, not a new dependency.

**IT ALSO DISSOLVES THE SECOND-IDENTITY WORKAROUND** (§2.16's "a notary should register a separate
identity"). That was treating a symptom, and only for notaries. If the notary never publishes
`holderRoot` at all, there is no `holderRoot` -> commitment link to leak, and no separate identity to
maintain. One fix, both problems.

**THE UNDERLYING LEAK IS NOT NOTARY-SPECIFIC, and this is the part worth acting on separately.**
`IdentityRegistry.register` carries BOTH `holder_root` and `commitment` as public inputs, so EVERY
user's identity is publicly linked to their pool commitment in calldata. Their ACTIVITY stays hidden
- a withdrawal never discloses the commitment - but PARTICIPATION is visible for everyone, not just
notaries. The clean fix is the same shape again: prove the document binding by INCLUSION in a
committed tree rather than by publishing the identifiers. `StateKeeper` already maintains a
`PoseidonSMT` (`registrationSmt`), so the structure exists; what is missing is putting the document
bindings in it and proving against its root.

**NOT BUILT.** Recorded with the design settled, because the current `bindNotaryIdentity` /
`_requireActiveNotary` shape is publicly identifying and should not be deployed to anyone who can be
targeted for it.

### 2.16b "HOW COULD THERE BE A FRAUD FINDING IF EVERYTHING IS SECRET" (user, 2026-07-29)

The question finds a real hole. §2.16a proposed conditional deanonymisation "on a fraud finding"
without ever specifying HOW FRAUD IS DETECTED. If the notary is anonymous, the property is an opaque
pseudonym and the holder is a commitment, nothing on-chain is legible enough for anyone to notice
wrongdoing - so the trigger for opening the envelope was assumed, not designed.

**PART ONE, WHICH IS FINE ONCE STATED: DETECTION IS OFF-CHAIN, AND SHOULD BE.** Notarial fraud is a
REAL-WORLD ACT - registering a lien or transfer against a property - and it leaves its trace in the
STATE CADASTRE, not here. The spec's §2.2 Tier 1 gives a property owner full view of every parcel and
encumbrance registered under their National ID via `Sabt-e Man`. That is where an owner sees a charge
they never authorised. A lender detects it differently and just as concretely: they appraised the
property, so they know exactly what they lent against, and discover the defect when they enforce.

So the chain is the ATTRIBUTION surface, not the DETECTION surface. Detection comes from a party who
already knows the underlying facts - the owner via the official registry, the lender via their own
underwriting - and the chain then supplies non-repudiable evidence of who attested what. That is
coherent, and it is what §2.16a should have said instead of "a fraud finding" as though it were
self-executing.

**PART TWO, AND THIS ONE IS AN ACTUAL GAP: NOBODY IS ASSIGNED TO COMPUTE `propertyKey`.**
§2.14b specified `PRF(registryKey, legalDescriptionHash)` "computed off-chain by the notary".
§2.15 then established that notaries compute nothing and hold no protocol key. **The correction was
never propagated** - `TitleLedger.sol:60` still says "computed off-chain by the notary", and no party
in the current design holds `registryKey`.

Consequences, both real:
- The mint path is unimplementable as written; someone must hold the key.
- **A property owner CANNOT CHECK whether their own property has been titled here**, because
  computing `propertyKey` needs a key they do not have. That is a detection path we lose - the owner
  can see a fraudulent entry in the STATE register, but not a fraudulent entry in OURS.

**THE CANDIDATES, none obviously right:**
- *The controller* (the party already managing labels and the blacklist) - simplest, but puts it in
  the path of every mint, which is a liveness and censorship dependency on exactly the party the
  rest of the design works to keep out of that position.
- *A protocol-wide constant* - no key custody at all, but then `propertyKey` is brute-forceable,
  since a *Shenaseh Yekta* is an 18-digit enumerable identifier. That is the confidentiality the
  keyed pseudonym existed to provide, given straight back.
- *The k-of-n legal guardian set* already proposed for deanonymisation, via a threshold PRF - no
  single party can brute-force, and it reuses a group the design already needs. Cost is a threshold
  interaction per mint.

**UNRESOLVED, and it is the same tension as §2.15's parcel nullifier** - the spec's own
`N = PoseidonHash(Cadastral_ID, Secret_Salt)` faces this identically. Settle it once, for both.
Until it is settled, `TitleLedger`'s propertyKey comment is stale and should not be read as a
specification.

### 2.17 "MORTGAGES MIGHT NOT BE VIABLE AT ALL?" - the honest answer (user, 2026-07-29)

**MY LENDER ARGUMENT IS DEAD, and the user killed it correctly.** §2.16b's detection story rested on
"the lender appraised the property, so they know what they lent against". **THERE IS NO LENDER.**
Underwriting comes from a pool of QUI holders - basket shares in the SPV - and there is no class
action either. So:

- **Nobody knows which property backs a loan**, so nobody notices a fraudulent title.
- **Nobody has standing**, so the conditional-deanonymisation trigger has no plaintiff.
- **The pool silently eats the loss**, and cannot even tell a loss from a defect.

That is not a gap in the mechanism; it removes the party the mechanism assumed.

**THE STRUCTURAL FACT.** Someone must (a) know the property, (b) have skin in the game, and (c) be
accountable. A diffuse pool has none of the three. The protocol CAN enforce the mechanical
predicates - the title is unique, a licensed notary attested it, LTV/DTI are within limits, payments
arrive, default is timed - but it CANNOT verify that a declared appraisal is honest or that the
property is worth what is claimed. Every one of those rests on the notary's attestation being TRUE,
which is a single point of failure the cryptography does not touch.

**SO: A FULLY TRUSTLESS POOLED MORTGAGE IS NOT VIABLE.** Saying otherwise would be dishonest. What IS
viable is narrower and worth stating precisely:

> A pool that funds loans ORIGINATED BY ACCOUNTABLE AGENTS, where the protocol enforces the
> mechanical parts and licensed humans carry the judgment parts.

That is how mortgage markets already work - originate-to-distribute - and the protocol's contribution
is privacy, automation and capital access, NOT the elimination of an underwriter.

**WHAT THE SPEC IS MISSING, and the user spotted it.** §6 hires post-default vendors - process
servers, auctioneers, REO brokers, preservation contractors - but NO PRE-DEFAULT ROLES. There is no
appraiser, no title investigator, no servicer, and no fraud investigator. Those are not optional:
- **Independent appraisal** as a separately attested role, ideally CRE-verified from a licensed
  appraisers' register exactly as notaries are - so valuation is not the notary's word alone.
- **A servicer** who knows the property and is compensated and liable, giving the pool an agent with
  standing where the pool itself has none.
- **Investigators.** Loss mitigation requires someone to investigate suspected fraud. Real servicing
  costs run roughly 25-50bps; this is a normal, PRICEABLE operating cost taken out of the interest
  spread - but it must be priced, not assumed away.

**WHAT SURVIVES WITHOUT ANY OF THIS.** Over-collateralisation does real work: at LTV <= 70% a 30%
buffer absorbs ordinary valuation error, though not outright fraud. And the notary's LICENCE is the
actual bond - a professional who can be struck off has more at stake than most crypto collateral,
which is exactly why §2.16 concluded no stake was needed.

**IMPLICATION FOR SCOPE, and it should be faced now rather than at field testing.** This strengthens
the case for shipping IDENTITY AND TITLE FIRST and treating lending as a later phase gated on the
agent roles existing. FUNDING-APPLICATION.md already commits to that shape - "where the assignment
instrument proves unenforceable we would ship the identity and title layers without the lending
layer" - and this is a second, independent reason for the same ordering. The identity and title work
is valuable ON ITS OWN: provable ownership without public disclosure does not depend on anyone
lending against it.

### 2.17a Notary anonymity: proceed on the §5 Option B pattern

Confirmed direction. The k-of-n legal guardian set the spec already specifies for the power of
attorney ALSO holds the notary-deanonymisation shares - one guardian set, two purposes, no new
trusted party. Concretely:
- The notary proves ZK set membership in the CRE-anchored active-notary snapshot; no identity on chain.
- The attestation carries a hashed-ElGamal envelope (`pp/src/envelope.nr`, built and tested) sealing
  their identity to the guardian set's threshold key.
- Opening requires k of n, on a stated predicate, exactly as the default bridge opens the PoA.

**BUT NOTE WHAT §2.17 DOES TO THE TRIGGER:** the guardians can only act on a COMPLAINT, and with no
lender there may be no complainant. The mechanism is sound and the plaintiff is missing - so the
servicer role above is a PREREQUISITE for this to mean anything, not an optimisation.

### 2.17b DISTRIBUTOR, NOT ORIGINATOR - and the minimum viable trustless configuration

**1. DISTRIBUTOR-ONLY IS THE VIABLE STRUCTURE, and it fixes what §2.17 broke.** If the pool BUYS
loans rather than writing them, the party who knows the property is the ORIGINATOR, and they are
contractually on the hook for it. The pool never needs to know which building it is; it needs the
originator's representations and a first-loss position. That is originate-to-distribute, i.e. how
RMBS has always worked, and it restores every role §2.17 found missing without inventing anything:
the originator appraises, verifies title, services, and investigates - because they eat the first
loss if they got it wrong.

**2. MINIMUM VIABLE CONFIGURATION.** "Trustless" cannot mean "no accountable party" for a loan
against an off-chain asset - the asset's existence and value are facts no oracle can settle
honestly. So the minimum is not zero trusted parties; it is:

> EXACTLY ONE accountable party per loan, whose accountability is COLLATERALISED ON-CHAIN rather
> than merely actionable in court.

Concretely:
- The originator posts FIRST-LOSS CAPITAL into the pool before their loans are funded.
- A loan that defaults for TITLE DEFECT slashes that capital automatically - no complaint, no
  plaintiff, no court in the loop. **That is what §2.17's missing-plaintiff problem needed**: the
  trigger becomes mechanical rather than adversarial.
- Courts become the BACKSTOP for losses exceeding first-loss, not the primary mechanism.
- Everything else the protocol already enforces: title uniqueness, licensed attestation, LTV/DTI,
  payment and default timing.

The pool's residual trust reduces to "the originator's first-loss is sized correctly", which is a
NUMBER that can be audited and adjusted, rather than "someone will sue on our behalf", which is a
hope. That is the honest floor - not trustless, but trust that is bounded, collateralised, and
priced.

### 2.17c MAXIMALLY ANONYMOUS OWNERSHIP ATTESTATION - buildable from what exists

The question: a CRE-verified notary proves someone owns a property, revealing NEITHER the owner NOR
the notary. Fully answerable with primitives already built and tested here.

**THE STATEMENT.** "There exists a notary N and an owner O such that N is in the currently active
notary set, N controls that identity, and N attests that O owns property P."

**PUBLIC:** the notary-set root (CRE-anchored), `propertyKey` (opaque), `ownerCommitment` (opaque),
a notary nullifier, and the sealed envelope. **PRIVATE:** which notary, which owner, which property.

**THE CIRCUIT, entirely from existing gadgets:**
1. `notary_root = extract_pk_identity_hash(sk_notary)` - proves CONTROL of the notary identity.
   (`pp/src/holder_root.nr`, already differential-tested.)
2. `notary_root` is INCLUDED in the CRE-anchored active-notary snapshot - a Merkle inclusion whose
   path is PRIVATE, so the set is public and the member is not. (`pp/src/smt.nr` or `lean_imt.nr`,
   both already used exactly this way for identities.)
3. `ownerCommitment == Poseidon(owner_holder_root, propertyKey)` - binds THIS owner to THIS property,
   with the owner's identity never appearing. Same shape as `title_holder`, which lets the owner
   later prove ownership themselves with the circuit that already exists.
4. `notary_nullifier == Poseidon(sk_notary, propertyKey)` - deterministic per (notary, property).
   Makes double-attestation on one property DETECTABLE without revealing who, and gives a
   rate-limiting handle. This is the epoch-pseudonym trick from §2.13e, third use.
5. The sealed envelope from `pp/src/envelope.nr` seals `notary_root` to the k-of-n guardian
   threshold key - so §2.17b's automatic slashing has a mechanical trigger, and guardians can open
   WHO attested only on a stated predicate.

**COST, estimable from measured neighbours:** two scalar multiplications (~11.8k opcodes each) for
the identity derivation and the envelope, one Merkle inclusion (~7.9k-11.9k depending on depth), and
a handful of Poseidons. Roughly 35-40k ACIR opcodes - the same order as `escrow_envelope`'s measured
38,874, and one-time per attestation rather than per transaction.

**NOT BUILT.** Every component exists and is tested; this is composition, not new cryptography.

### 2.17d THE 30% RATE, what "priced" means, and the KICKBACK ATTACK (user, 2026-07-29)

**1. WOULD BUYING LOANS FIX THE ~30% RATE? MOSTLY NOT, AND WE MUST NOT CLAIM IT DOES.**

An Iranian mortgage rate near 30% is overwhelmingly INFLATION, not intermediary margin. Nominal
rates track a price level running at similar magnitude, so 30% nominal may be NEGATIVE in real terms.
Distribution widens the funding base and can compress the SPREAD - the intermediary's cut, and the
risk premium charged for opacity - but no capital structure deflates a currency.

The three honest levers, and their costs:
- **Compress the spread.** Real, but it is basis points against tens of percent. Do not present a
  spread improvement as a rate improvement.
- **Change the unit of account** to hard currency at 4.5-5%, per the spec's Model A. The nominal
  number collapses - and the borrower now earns rial and owes dollars. A devaluation turns a
  serviceable loan into a default machine. **This moves risk onto the least able party to bear it**,
  and presenting it as a cheaper mortgage would be dishonest.
- **CPI-indexed IRR**, also in the spec. The honest structure: the rate tracks the price level, so
  the REAL rate is low and the borrower is not exposed to devaluation beyond their own income's.
  The nominal number stays high and that is CORRECT, not a failure.

**The claim we can defend: a lower REAL rate and access for people banks will not serve.** Not a
lower nominal number.

**2. WHAT "BOUNDED, COLLATERALISED, PRICED" MEANS - concretely.**
- **Bounded**: the maximum loss from one accountable party's failure is a KNOWN NUMBER - their
  first-loss capital - rather than open-ended.
- **Collateralised**: that number is capital locked on-chain, not a promise to pay later.
- **Priced**: the residual risk beyond it is charged for in the rate, so the pool is compensated
  rather than surprised.

If an originator posts 10% first-loss against their book, the pool's exposure to their misconduct
starts only beyond 10%, and that 10% is auditable on-chain. That is the whole content of the phrase.

**3. THE KICKBACK ATTACK, and it defeats stake by construction.**

A notary bribed enough does not care about losing a stake. If a fraudulent title extracts 100 and the
stake is 10, they take the bribe. **Any stake small enough to be postable is small enough to be
outbid**, so slashing is not a defence against a bribed professional. This is the correct objection
and it is why §2.16 concluded no crypto stake for notaries - not as an omission but as a conclusion.

**I MUST BE PRECISE ABOUT WHO POSTS WHAT, because §2.17b blurred it:**
- The **ORIGINATOR** posts first-loss capital. That works: an originator is a business with capital,
  a book of repeat business, and losses that scale with their own portfolio.
- The **NOTARY** posts NOTHING. Their bond is their LICENCE and their LIBERTY - a struck-off notary
  loses their lifetime professional income, and fraud and bribery are crimes. That is worth orders
  of magnitude more than any postable stake, and it does not capital-gate a professional role.

**What actually defends against notary collusion:**
- **DETECTION is independent of the protocol** - the owner sees the unauthorised entry in the STATE
  cadastre (spec §2.2 Tier 1). A bribed notary cannot suppress that; it is the government's register,
  not ours.
- **ATTRIBUTION** via the guardian-opened envelope, naming them.
- **CONSEQUENCE** is licence loss and prosecution, not slashing.
- **SEPARATION OF ROLES**: the notary and the originator MUST be distinct parties, so fraud requires
  collusion between two accountable actors rather than one. If a deployment lets them be the same
  entity, that is a design error and should be prevented in the contract, not the documentation.

**AND THE HONEST RESIDUAL: collusion between a notary and a borrower is not solved by cryptography.**
No proof system establishes that an off-chain document describes a real building. Real markets do not
solve this cryptographically either - they BUY TITLE INSURANCE against exactly this, and price it.
That is what "priced" should point at for this risk class, and a deployment without either title
insurance or an originator first-loss deep enough to stand in for it is under-capitalised regardless
of how good the circuits are.

### 2.17e ORIGINATORS: the plan, and why TIER 2 changes the risk picture (user, 2026-07-29)

**MY TITLE-INSURANCE ANSWER WAS US-CENTRIC AND LARGELY WRONG HERE.** Title insurance exists mainly
in RECORDING systems (US/Canada), where the register is evidence of a claim and a private insurer
underwrites the gap. Iran runs a CIVIL-LAW STATE CADASTRE (*Sazman-e Sabt*): registration is
constitutive, the state deed IS the title, and the STATE stands behind the register. Private title
insurance is largely redundant in that model and may simply not exist locally. So "the originator
has title insurance handled" is probably the wrong question - **needs local confirmation, but the
structural answer is that the state register plays the role I was assigning to an insurer.**

**AND SPEC §2.2 TIER 2 IS THE PART I UNDER-WEIGHTED.** *"General Public / Lenders - Deed Authenticity
Check (Tasdiq-e Asalat) - can verify deed authenticity by submitting the 18-digit Unique ID +
Owner's National ID."*

**AN ORIGINATOR CAN INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY THE DEED AGAINST THE STATE.** That collapses the threat I
have been building elaborate machinery around: the notary is NOT a single point of failure, because
their attestation is CORROBORABLE against the government's own system by the party taking the risk.
A bribed notary cannot forge a deed the state will not confirm.

**THIS SHOULD BE CRE-ATTESTED, and it is the highest-value unrecorded item.** The same oracle pattern
already built for the notary register can run the Tier 2 authenticity check, putting on-chain
evidence that the deed is genuine - independent of BOTH the notary and the originator. That reduces
trust in both simultaneously, using machinery that exists (`backend/cre/notary_registry/main.go` is
the template). It is a better use of effort than anything downstream of assuming the notary lied.

**THE ORIGINATOR PLAN.**

*What they do* (none of it protocol-replaceable): the Tier 2 deed check; appraisal; borrower
underwriting for DTI; servicing and collection; loss mitigation and investigation.

*What they post*: first-loss capital, sized against their book, slashed automatically on a title
defect (§2.17b) - so the trigger is mechanical and needs no plaintiff.

*What they warrant*: representations on deed authenticity, valuation basis, and borrower identity -
enforceable in-jurisdiction, which is what the first-loss backstops rather than replaces.

*What the protocol enforces*: lien uniqueness, LTV/DTI at origination, payment schedule, default
timing, and the slashing.

*ROLE SEPARATION IS MANDATORY*: originator != notary, so any fraud needs two accountable parties
colluding. This must be enforced in the contract, not the documentation.

**WHO THEY ACTUALLY ARE - the honest weak point.** In a sanctioned jurisdiction the banks are
constrained, which is the project's whole premise, so originators are likely licensed non-bank credit
institutions or real-estate finance companies. **Recruiting even one is a
BUSINESS-DEVELOPMENT problem, not a technical one, and it is the single most likely reason the
lending layer never ships.** The realistic path is ONE vetted originator, a small book, and first-loss
set deliberately high, to prove the mechanics before widening. That is also why §2.17's conclusion
stands: identity and title first, lending gated on an originator existing at all.

### 2.17f WHAT THE NOTARY/CRE LINK IS ACTUALLY FOR, and how originators are onboarded

Four questions that together ask whether the notary machinery earns its keep. Reading §2.2 against
§2.15 answers all of them, and corrects a conflation I have been carrying.

**1. THE CONCRETE BENEFIT - I WAS CONFLATING VERIFICATION WITH EXECUTION.**
Tier 2 verifies a deed is authentic, and ANYONE may do it. Tier 3's exclusive powers are different:
*"query active encumbrances, REGISTER MORTGAGES, and EXECUTE BINDING TITLE TRANSFERS using hardware
tokens."*

So a notary's unique capability is not "tell us this title is real" - Tier 2 does that better,
independently, and without trusting them. It is **MAKING THE LIEN LEGALLY EXIST.** A mortgage
registered by a non-notary is VOID, and a pool holding a void lien holds nothing.

**That is the whole point of the CRE link, and it is narrow and real:** it proves the person
executing the legal registration was licensed to do so at the time. The attestation is about the
LIEN, not the title. Everything I wrote treating the notary as the source of truth about the
PROPERTY was misdirected - Tier 2 owns that.

**2. FRAUD DEFENCE WITHOUT DEANONYMISATION - and it needs no complaint.**
A notary who claims to have registered a lien either did or did not, and the state register says
which. CRE-attest a FOLLOW-UP Tier 1/Tier 2 query: does the encumbrance actually appear? If the
notary took the fee and never registered it, the lien is absent and that is MECHANICALLY DETECTABLE
by oracle, from state data, **without knowing which notary it was.**

Only when the check FAILS is there cause to open the envelope. So anonymity holds in the normal case,
detection needs no plaintiff (which §2.17 established we do not have), and deanonymisation is
reserved for a proven discrepancy rather than a suspicion.

**3. ONBOARDING ORIGINATORS - the same mechanism, not a new trust assumption.**
*How we know they are real:* licensed credit institutions appear on a FINANCIAL REGULATOR'S PUBLIC
REGISTER. Scrape it, attest it by DON consensus - byte-identical across nodes - exactly as
`backend/cre/notary_registry/main.go` already does for notaries. Same pattern, third register.

*Why they work with us:* access to capital they cannot otherwise reach, given the banking
constraints that are this project's premise; origination and servicing income without committing
their own balance sheet; and they keep the customer relationship.

*Why we work with them:* they hold the licence, the staff and the legal standing we do not, and they
carry first-loss.

**4. "IS IT BACK TO TRUSTING THE NOTARIES ABOUT THE ORIGINATORS?" NO - NOBODY VOUCHES FOR ANYBODY.**
Three INDEPENDENT state sources, each attested separately:
- notary register -> licensed to execute liens
- financial regulator register -> licensed to originate
- cadastre Tier 2 -> the deed is genuine

No party in this system attests to another party's standing. That is the entire reason for using
REGISTERS rather than reputation or vouching, and it is why a corrupt notary cannot smuggle in a fake
originator: they have no say in it.

**THE DEEPEST RESIDUAL, and it should be stated plainly rather than discovered later.** The trust root
of all three is THE STATE'S OWN REGISTERS. That is strong against PRIVATE fraud - a bribed notary,
a fake originator, a forged deed - and worth nothing against STATE-LEVEL FABRICATION. A government
that wants to conjure a licensed notary or a genuine-looking deed can.

This sits in tension with the threat model, where the state is the surveillance adversary. The
tension is COHERENT - one can trust that a passport is genuinely issued while not wanting the issuer
to watch one's transactions, and the identity layer already rests on exactly that - but it bounds
what this system claims. It defends the user's PRIVACY from the state. It does not defend the
protocol's INTEGRITY from the state, and no amount of cryptography over state-issued credentials
would.

### 2.18 ELIMINATING THE PARTICIPATION LEAK - verified design, every piece already exists

*"try to eliminate leaks. this needs to be as trustless as possible"* (user, 2026-07-29).

**THE LEAK.** `IdentityRegistry.register` publishes `holder_root`, `commitment` AND `dg1_hash` as
public inputs, so calldata links every user's IDENTITY to their POOL HANDLE. Activity stays private -
a withdrawal never discloses the commitment, it is a private SMT key - but PARTICIPATION is public
for everyone. It also makes `holderOfDocumentHash(dg1_hash)` a second path to the same link. This is
the largest privacy defect in our own code and it affects every user, not just notaries.

**THE FIX: prove the document binding by INCLUSION, publish no identifier.** The identifiers exist
only so the contract can check `holderOfDocumentHash(dg1Hash) == holderRoot` - the scarcity link
(§2.13n trap 5). Prove that inside the circuit instead and nothing needs publishing.

**EVERY PIECE ALREADY EXISTS - checked, not assumed:**
1. **The committed tree is already there.** `HolderStateKeeper._bindDocument` writes
   `Poseidon(documentKey, holderRoot) -> Poseidon(dgCommit, seq, timestamp)` into
   `StateKeeper.registrationSmt`. We do not need to build or populate anything.
2. **Hashers are compatible.** `PoseidonSMT` uses `PoseidonUnit2L`/`PoseidonUnit3L` - the exact pair
   `SmtCompat.t.sol` already proved byte-identical to the Noir gadget.
3. **Root policy already correct.** `PoseidonSMT.isRootValid` = latest OR within `ROOT_VALIDITY`
   (1 hour), the same always-valid-latest shape as the identity registry. And for an INCLUSION tree
   old roots are SAFE anyway (fewer members), so this is strictly more than needed.
4. **Soundness comes from `dgCommit`, which IS proof-bound.** `documentKey` is NOT constrained by any
   proof (§2.13f), so proving inclusion on the INDEX alone would be weak. But the leaf VALUE contains
   `dgCommit = extract_dg1_commitment(dg1, sk_identity)` - derived from the holder's OWN secret. An
   attacker cannot produce a valid `dgCommit` for someone else's leaf without their `sk_identity`, so
   inclusion plus a re-derived `dgCommit` is sound even though the index is not.

**NEW PUBLIC INPUTS:** `controller_x/y`, `commitment`, `registration_root`, `c1_x/y`, `sealed[5]`.
**GONE:** `holder_root`, `dg1_hash`. `registration_root` is shared by EVERY user, so it identifies
nobody.

**MEASURED: 28,302 ACIR opcodes** for the private binding (identity derivation + `dgCommit` +
depth-32 inclusion). The escrow circuit goes roughly 38,874 -> ~52-55k, about +38%, and it is the
ONE-TIME registration path, never the withdrawal hot path. That is the right place to spend it.

**NOT YET BUILT.** Requires: escrow circuit rewrite, `IdentityRegistry.register` checking
`registrationSmt.isRootValid` instead of `holderOfDocumentHash`, three escrow fixtures and the
verifier regenerated, tests updated.

### 2.18 BUILT. Measured 70,223 - the sec. 2.18 estimate was wrong about the DEPTH

**MEASURED: 38,874 -> 70,223 ACIR opcodes (+81%)**, not the ~52-55k predicted. The prediction sized
the inclusion at DEPTH 32 - the IDENTITY registry's height. `registrationSmt` is a rarime
`PoseidonSMT` initialised at **80** everywhere it is deployed, and `query_identity` already took
`siblings: [Field; 80]`, so the number was checkable and I did not check it.

For context, all measured today: register_identity 72,932 | escrow 70,223 | query_identity_td1
46,797 | withdraw_identity 24,812 | title_holder 12,969 | ragequit 997. Escrow now costs about what
REGISTRATION costs, on the same one-time path. **The withdrawal hot path is untouched at 24,812.**

**PUBLIC INPUTS 12 -> 11.** Gone: `holder_root`, `dg1_hash`. Added: `registration_root`, shared by
every user of the system. The verifier is still **24,491 bytes** - unchanged - which confirms again
that verifier size is flat in public-input count (sec. 2.13i), even across a circuit that nearly
doubled in constraints.

**REUSED `identity_state_verifier` RATHER THAN REBUILDING THE LEAF.** It already existed in
`noir_dl_lib/src/query.nr`, private; made `pub`. A hand-written second copy of
`Poseidon(documentKey, holderRoot) -> Poseidon(dgCommit, seq, timestamp)` would have been free to
drift from the one `query_identity` uses, with nothing to notice.

**TWO DEFECTS CLOSED AS SIDE EFFECTS, both found while wiring it:**
1. **A REVOKED DOCUMENT COULD STILL REGISTER AN IDENTITY.** `_holderOfDocumentHash` is written at
   binding and NEVER cleared - not by `revokeDocument`, not by `renewDocument`. So the old check
   passed for a cancelled passport. The tree cannot be fooled that way: revocation overwrites the
   leaf VALUE with `Poseidon1(REVOKED)`, which no `Poseidon3(dgCommit, seq, timestamp)`
   reconstruction equals. **The new check is strictly stronger than the one it replaces.**
2. **THE ROOT CHECK RAN AFTER PROOF VERIFICATION.** I wrote a comment claiming it ran before, did
   not verify it, and the test caught me: tampering with a public input makes the generated verifier
   revert `SumcheckFailed()` first, so the useful error never surfaced. Reordered - a mapping read
   before a ~500k-gas Honk verification - and now the comment is true.

**RESIDUAL, recorded rather than left implicit (sec. 2.18b).** `PoseidonSMT.isRootValid` = latest OR
within ROOT_VALIDITY (1 hour). Because `revokeDocument` moves a leaf's VALUE, for up to an hour
after a document is cancelled its pre-revocation root still admits an escrow. Bounded and
correctable - the identity is still revocable afterwards - but it is NOT the "old roots are safe on
an inclusion tree" argument sec. 2.18 made, because this tree carries status too.

### 2.18a THE BLACKLIST WAS EVADABLE BY EVERYONE IT APPLIED TO

Found while removing `holder_root`: `IdentityRegistry` guards on `registered[commitment]` and
**nothing else**. While the escrowed secret was freely chosen, a revoked user could escrow a FRESH
secret against the SAME passport, get a DIFFERENT commitment, and register clean. `dg1Hash` still
bound to their `holderRoot`, so every check passed.

**THE FIX IS ONE POSEIDON.** `revocation_secret = Poseidon(sk_identity, "pp:revocation-secret:v1")`,
so the commitment is a FUNCTION of the identity: one identity, one commitment,
`registered[commitment]` becomes the per-holder guard, and re-registration reverts
`AlreadyRegistered`. Pinned by `test_ARevokedIdentityCannotRegisterAgain`, which the old design
could not have passed.

The domain separator is checked against its own string in-circuit
(`test_revocation_domain_is_the_string_it_claims_to_be`) and asserted distinct from
`extract_pk_identity_hash` - both are Poseidon over two fields, and a dropped separator would have
handed anyone who saw a published holder root the secret that revokes it.

**WHAT IT DOES NOT CLAIM:** two passports under two DIFFERENT `sk_identity` values are still two
identities. Nothing in ICAO 9303 links two states' documents - which is exactly why the MRZ rides
inside the envelope for the controller to attribute. What is closed is free re-registration of the
SAME identity, which needed no second passport at all.

### 2.18b THE FIXTURE PIPELINE, and the hand-built steps it replaces

The witness comes from the REAL contract, never rebuilt off-chain - the rule `identityProof.ts` and
`fixture-common.js` already established. Five steps, each consuming the last:

1. `node tools/build-escrow-fixtures.js --documents 3` -> `escrow_documents.json`
2. `forge test --match-test test_EmitRegistrationWitnessFixture` -> `registration_witness.json`
3. `node tools/build-escrow-fixtures.js 3` -> `Prover.escrow<i>.toml`
4. `backend/circuits/codegen-verifiers.sh` -> verifier + vk
5. `tools/prove-escrow-fixtures.sh` -> `escrow_envelope<i>.proof/.public`  **(NEW)**

**`dgCommit` IS TAKEN FROM THE CIRCUIT, NOT REIMPLEMENTED.** The generator shells out to
`nargo execute` on `register_identity_light_td1` and reads its output. Writing
`extract_dg1_commitment` in JS would have meant a second implementation of a bit-packing convention
with three places to get the endianness wrong. Cross-checked: the circuit's `dg1_hash` and `sk_hash`
outputs equal the values the generator computes independently, which is what licenses trusting it
for the one value we cannot derive here.

**STEP 5 DID NOT EXIST.** The three numbered proofs had been produced BY HAND with nothing in the
repo recording the commands - the same defect as a header naming a generator that does not exist.

**THE CROSS-IMPLEMENTATION RESULT THAT MATTERS:** a witness produced by solarity's on-chain
`SparseMerkleTree` is accepted by the circomlib SMT gadget in Noir. That is genuine agreement
between two independent implementations, not a self-consistent loop.

### 2.18c THE COMMITTED ragequit.proof CORRESPONDED TO NO COMMITTED WITNESS

Surfaced by regenerating. `RagequitHonkVerifier.t.sol` has always documented its fixture as the
differential vector `(value 10, label 20, nullifier 30, secret 40)` cross-checked against
poseidon-solidity - but `ragequit/Prover.toml` was overwritten with the END-TO-END witness
(value 1e18, a real label) during the single-identity-tree merge, and the fixture was never
re-proved. So the committed proof was **unreproducible**, and the next codegen run would silently
replace it with one the test rejects. That is exactly what happened.

Fixed with `ragequit/Prover.baseline.toml`, which `codegen-verifiers.sh` prefers over `Prover.toml`
- the same protection `withdraw_identity` already had, and the reason it has it.

### 2.18d THERE IS NO KEY RECOVERY (user, 2026-07-29)

*"there is no recovery possible with the enclave"* - correct, and worse than "an enclave key cannot
be exported". From `frontend/identity-wallet/src/identity/root.ts`:

- `getOrCreateRootMnemonic()` GENERATES a 24-word phrase. **There is no import path anywhere** -
  nothing calls `Mnemonic.fromPhrase` on user input.
- The phrase is **never displayed**, so the user cannot write it down.
- `keychainAccessible: WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY` **excludes it from iCloud Keychain and device
  backups** by design.
- `requireAuthentication: true` binds it to current biometric enrolment, which re-enrolment can
  invalidate.

Lost or wiped phone -> identity and every pool note gone permanently.

**THE NUANCE THAT DECIDES THE FIX:** this is NOT a non-extractable Secure Enclave key. It is a value
STORED IN Keychain/Keystore, readable by the app after biometric auth. So recovery is a feature we
never built, not a physical impossibility.

**AGAINST THE MPC/SOCIAL-RECOVERY SDKs** (Web3Auth, Turnkey, Privy, Para): every one introduces a
server-side party, and most gate on Google/Apple OAuth - precisely the deniable-refusal lever the
distributor argument exists to remove (sec. 2.22c) - plus a US-operated dependency for Iranian
users. It would contradict sec. 5's censorship claims and sec. 7's "no infrastructure to run".

**THE CONSISTENT ANSWER** is an encrypted backup the user controls: the mnemonic sealed under a user
passphrase, ciphertext storable anywhere, recovery = passphrase + blob, no custodian. NOT BUILT.
FUNDING-APPLICATION.md sec. 6 now discloses the gap and puts the fix in milestone 2; the
participation-leak disclosure it replaced is the one closed by sec. 2.18 above.

### 2.18e BOTH DEFECTS ADDRESSED (user: "address the defects")

**1. THE STALE-ROOT WINDOW IS CLOSED, not shrunk.** sec. 2.18b left up to an hour in which a
CANCELLED passport could still register a pool identity, because revoking a document overwrites its
leaf VALUE while roots created earlier keep proving it current, and `isRootValid` accepts those for
the rest of `ROOT_VALIDITY`.

Three small pieces: `PoseidonSMT.getRootTimestamp` (a view - no storage change, UUPS-safe),
`HolderStateKeeper.lastDocumentInvalidationAt` (set by `revokeDocument` AND `renewDocument`), and a
second condition in `register` requiring the cited root be newer than the last invalidation.

**I GOT THE COMPARISON BACKWARDS AND THE TEST CAUGHT IT.** `withRootUpdate` calls `_saveRoot()`
BEFORE mutating the tree, so `_roots[R]` is when R **STOPPED** being current, not when it started -
the opposite of what the getter name suggests, and the reason `isRootValid` means "superseded less
than an hour ago". The root superseded BY the invalidation therefore carries exactly
`lastDocumentInvalidationAt`, so the test must be `<=`. With `<` the very root that still shows the
cancelled document as current would have passed. Both the code and the doc comment I had written
around it were wrong; the boundary is now asserted explicitly in the test because it is the mistake
I actually made.

The LATEST root skips the check and must: the current root has NO `_roots` entry, so it reads as 0
and would be rejected forever. It is also always safe - any invalidation moves the root.

Verified by removal: with the guard deleted the registration SUCCEEDS, so the attack was real and
the test is load-bearing.

**2. KEY RECOVERY EXISTS (sec. 2.18d).** `src/identity/recovery.ts` + wrappers in `root.ts`:
`revealRootMnemonic` (the wallet was previously unbackupable BY CONSTRUCTION - the phrase was
generated on-device and never displayed), `importRootMnemonic`, `exportEncryptedBackup`,
`restoreFromEncryptedBackup`.

**FORMAT: the Web3 keystore v3 ethers already implements** - scrypt N=131072, AES-128-CTR,
MAC-checked. No new dependency, and readable by any standard tool if this wallet disappears, which
for a recovery artefact is the property that matters. Measured first: it round-trips a 24-word
phrase exactly (32 bytes of entropy - the field has a history of assuming 16).

**A PRIVACY DEFECT IN THE OBVIOUS IMPLEMENTATION, found by measuring rather than by review.** The
keystore writes a plaintext `address` - for `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`, which is EXACTLY the path
`src/pp/notes.ts` uses for Privacy Pool account 0. An unmodified backup would publish, in the clear,
an address derived from the same key material as the user's note secrets: a stable identifier
linking every copy of the backup to every other. Stripped, along with `gethFilename` (address +
creation time) and `id`. **`address` cannot merely be blanked** - ethers checks it against the
decrypted key and rejects a zeroed one; DELETING it restores cleanly. Both behaviours are pinned,
because a future ethers that required the field would break every backup silently.

**GUARDS:** BIP39 validated BEFORE storing (a mistyped phrase derives the WRONG keys perfectly well
and shows an empty wallet, not an error, with the real phrase already overwritten); a
private-key-only keystore is rejected rather than restoring an identity-less wallet; restore refuses
by default over an existing seed (`WalletAlreadyExistsError`) because that is silent and
irreversible; minimum passphrase length, since the file is meant to be stored off the device.

**AGAINST THE MPC SDKs** - unchanged from sec. 2.18d: every one puts a share on a server and most
gate on Google/Apple sign-in, which is the deniable-refusal lever sec. 2.22c exists to remove.

**TESTED BY A SCRIPT THAT RUNS**, per the standing rule. `recovery.ts` is deliberately PURE - no
expo-secure-store, no React Native - so `tools/check-recovery.js` exercises it under node: 14
assertions, verified by removal (deleting the address strip -> 2 FAIL; deleting the
no-mnemonic guard -> 1 FAIL). An import of SecureStore into that file silently deletes the only test
this code has.

Recorded honestly: a two-word SWAP of correct words is not always caught by the BIP39 checksum. The
script reports the real behaviour rather than asserting a hoped-for one.

### 2.18f "ONLY A NOTARY CAN MAKE A MORTGAGE LEGALLY EXIST?" - overstated twice

*(user, 2026-07-29.)* The application said "Only a notary can make a mortgage legally exist - one
registered by anyone else is void." Two errors:

1. **"VOID" IS WRONG.** Under the Land Registration Act (قانون ثبت اسناد و املاک), a private
   document (سند عادی) concerning registered immovable property is **inadmissible before courts and
   government offices** - Article 48 - rather than void ab initio. The practical consequence for us
   is the same (it cannot be foreclosed through the official machinery, and creates no registered
   lien binding third parties), but the legal characterisation is not.
2. **"ONLY" IS TOO BROAD.** A notary monopoly holds for a **CONSENSUAL** mortgage. Non-consensual
   liens exist: the judiciary imposes seizures (*Bāzdāsht*) directly - the spec's own Tier 4. Our
   mortgages are consensual, so the claim holds for our use, but not as stated.

Corrected in FUNDING-APPLICATION.md sec. 2. **This is exactly the class of claim the local counsel
in milestone 3 is budgeted for** - it is drawn from spec.pdf plus general knowledge of Iranian
registration law, not from an opinion by anyone qualified to give one.

### 2.18g THE APPROVAL STEP WE CLAIMED TO HAVE REMOVED IS STILL THERE, ONE LAYER UP

Found while asking which of the 15 untested inherited contracts are actually reachable. **This is
the most serious defect in the design, and it invalidates a claim made in four places.**

**THE CHAIN OF REASONING, each step verified in the code:**
1. `IdentityRegistry.register` IS permissionless - proof-gated, no role, no signature. True.
2. But it requires the document to already be bound in `StateKeeper.registrationSmt` (sec. 2.18).
3. `registrationSmt` is written only via `_bindDocument`, reachable only through
   `HolderStateKeeper.addDocument`/`renewDocument`, both `onlyRegistration`.
4. Our registration contract is `HolderRegistration`. **EVERY** entry point on it -
   `registerDocumentViaNoir`, `renewDocumentViaNoir`, `revokeDocumentViaSigner` - routes through
   `_authenticateDocument`, which does `require(_isSigner(signer_))`.

**SO REGISTRATION IS GATED BY A BACKEND SIGNER'S ECDSA SIGNATURE.** A key we hold can be ordered to
withhold, and the person is blocked - which is EXACTLY the censorship-by-inaction lever the whole
blacklist design exists to remove. We moved the lever upstream and then described the downstream
half as if it were the system.

**THE SECOND FALSE CLAIM, same root cause.** Comments in `IdentityRegistry.sol` and
`escrow_envelope/src/main.nr` both say the ICAO signature chain "is verified during REGISTRATION".
On our path it is NOT verified on-chain at all: `RegistrationSimple` (which `HolderRegistration`
follows) checks a signer's signature and a Noir proof over DG1, and nothing else. **The trust root
for "this is a genuine passport" is our own signer key, not the issuing state's signature.**

**THE FIX IS INHERITED, UNUSED AND UNTESTED - it is those very "15 untested contracts".**
`Registration2.registerViaNoir` takes **NO signature**. It is gated only by a ZK proof against
`certificatesRoot_`, a certificates SMT that `registerCertificate` populates by verifying ICAO
signatures ON-CHAIN against `stateKeeper.icaoMasterTreeMerkleRoot()`, using the certificate
dispatchers and signers (`CECDSADispatcher`, `CRSAPSSSigner`, `CECDSA384Signer`, ...) that showed up
in the untested list. **They are not cruft. They are the trustless path we are not on.**

**THIS REFRAMES THE "UNTESTED CONTRACTS" ITEM ENTIRELY.** It was on the list as a coverage gap. It
is actually the missing half of the censorship-resistance property.

**THE SHAPE OF THE FIX IS ADDITIVE, NOT A REPLACEMENT.** `StateKeeper._registrations` is a MAP of
named registration contracts, so more than one may be authorised at once. The signer path can stay
as the cheap, convenient default; what must exist alongside it is a permissionless path nobody can
withhold - the same relationship `ragequit` has to `withdraw`. A user who is refused a signature
must still be able to register by proving the certificate chain themselves, on-chain, at their own
gas cost.

**NOT YET BUILT.** Requires: an ICAO-verifying registration contract writing into the HOLDER tree
(`addDocument`, not upstream's 1:1 `addBond`); the certificate dispatchers/signers under test for
the first time; and `icaoMasterTreeMerkleRoot` actually populated, which is its own operational
question - who publishes the ICAO master list, and can THAT be withheld?

**CLAIMS CORRECTED MEANWHILE**, rather than left standing while the build is pending:
FUNDING-APPLICATION.md sec. 5 and sec. 6, `IdentityRegistry.sol`, `escrow_envelope/src/main.nr`.

### 2.18h SCOPING THE PERMISSIONLESS PATH - much smaller than feared, and it RELOCATES the gate

**THE DISPATCHERS ARE NOT NEEDED. `register_identity` VERIFIES THE WHOLE ICAO CHAIN IN-CIRCUIT.**
Reading it settles sec. 2.18g's build estimate downward by a lot:
1. `passport_verification_flow` - DG1 hashes into EC, EC into the signed attributes (the SOD chain)
2. `verify_signature` - the DSC's RSA/ECDSA signature over those attributes, in-circuit
3. `smt_verifier::<80>(icao_root, leaf, key, branches)` - the DSC public key's inclusion in the ICAO
   master tree
Returns `(dg15_pk_hash, passport_hash, dg1_commitment, sk_hash)` and passes `icao_root` through.

So the contract needs only: verify the Honk proof, check the root, call `addDocument`.

**I THEN CLAIMED "NO CERTIFICATE DISPATCHER, NO SIGNER CONTRACT". THAT WAS WRONG - SEE sec. 2.18l.**
The dispatchers are what POPULATE the tree the circuit walks. Correction kept in place rather than
edited away, because the reasoning that produced it looked sound: the circuit really does verify the
signature chain in-circuit, and it is easy to conclude from that alone that nothing on-chain needs
to parse a certificate. What it does not tell you is where the tree of legitimate signer keys comes
from.

**THE GATE MOVES, IT DOES NOT VANISH - and the difference is the whole point.**
`StateKeeper.changeICAOMasterTreeRoot` is `onlyOwner`. So:

- **TODAY (signer gate):** per-user, per-registration. The signer can refuse YOU, specifically and
  silently, and nobody else can tell it happened. **This is targeted, deniable discrimination** -
  precisely the failure sec. 2.22c says the whole distributor argument exists to remove.
- **AFTER (ICAO-root gate):** systemic and public. An owner can refuse EVERYONE by freezing the root
  or never updating it. They CANNOT refuse one person, because the proof is self-service and the
  root is global. A stale root is publicly observable.

**Converting a targeted, invisible, per-person refusal into an all-or-nothing visible one is the
property we actually need.** You cannot discriminate with an all-or-nothing lever. Claiming "no gate"
would still be false, and I should not write that.

**THE REMAINING STEP, for later:** anchor the ICAO root through the same CRE consensus pattern the
notary registry uses (`ConsensusIdenticalAggregation`, every DON node fetching independently and
agreeing byte-for-byte). That removes the owner's discretion over the root too. The ICAO master list
is public data, so this is the same shape of problem as indexing the notary register.

**A TRAP TO AVOID WHEN BUILDING IT - THE ANTI-REPLAY KEY DIFFERS BETWEEN THE TWO PATHS.**
`HolderRegistration._replayKey` uses `dg1Hash`, which is what the LIGHT circuit returns. The full
circuit returns `passport_hash` (over the SOD's signed attributes) and NOT `dg1_hash`. If the
permissionless path keyed anti-replay on `passportHash` while the signer path keys on `dg1Hash`,
**the same physical passport could be bound TWICE, under two different holder roots** - destroying
the document-scarcity guarantee the whole identity blacklist rests on. That is the exact defect
sec. 2.13n's `_replayKey` fix closed, reappearing through a second door.

Fix: add `dg1_hash` as an extra public output of `register_identity`. The sha256 over DG1 is already
computed inside `passport_verification_flow`, so it costs ~nothing beyond the output slot. Do NOT
switch the light path to `passportHash` - it is not proof-bound there, which is what started this.

**ALSO NOTE THE LENGTHS DIFFER.** `register_identity`'s main takes `[u8; 93]` (TD3) while our light
path and `escrow_envelope` are 95 (TD1). A TD3-registered document could not be escrowed until the
TD3 escrow variant already noted in `escrow_envelope/src/main.nr` exists. A TD1 variant of the full
circuit is the smaller move.

**BUILD ORDER:** dg1_hash output + TD1 variant of the full circuit -> Solidity verifier via
codegen-verifiers.sh -> a signature-free entry point binding via `addDocument` -> tests -> then the
CRE anchoring of the ICAO root as a separate piece.

### 2.18i THE ANTI-REPLAY TRAP IS ELIMINATED STRUCTURALLY, NOT BY REMEMBERING

sec. 2.18h recorded a trap to avoid when building the permissionless path: the two registration
paths would key anti-replay on DIFFERENT values (`dg1Hash` from the light circuit, `passport_hash`
from the full one), letting the SAME passport bind twice under two holder roots - once through each
door - and destroying the document scarcity the identity blacklist rests on.

**A note saying "remember not to do this" is not a fix.** Three changes make it structural:

1. **ONE DEFINITION OF THE PACKING.** `lite::dg1_hash_field` extracted from
   `register_identity_light`. The convention - skip digest[0], read the remaining 31 bytes
   big-endian - is not obvious (32 bytes do not fit BN254, and this drops the FIRST byte rather than
   truncating the last), so a second hand-written copy was the likeliest way to diverge.
   **Behaviour-preserving, verified on the committed vector: dgCommit, dg1_hash and sk_hash all
   byte-identical, and the circuit is 16,180 opcodes exactly as before.**
2. **THE FULL CIRCUIT NOW RETURNS `dg1_hash`** as a sixth public output, computed with that same
   function. 72,932 -> 73,348 opcodes (+416, the extra sha256 - consistent with the 396 measured for
   the same binding in sec. 2.13i). The permissionless path can therefore key on exactly what
   `_replayKey` already uses.
3. **TWO TESTS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM WORKS - WHICH I FOUND BY BREAKING IT.**
   `register_identity::test_dg1_hash_agrees_with_the_light_registration_path` compares the two
   paths, but both call the shared function, so corrupting the packing moves both together and **the
   test still passed**. It catches a path that INLINES its own copy, which is the realistic
   regression, and nothing more. The load-bearing guard is
   `lite::test_dg1_hash_field_matches_the_published_vector`, a KNOWN-ANSWER test against a value
   computed OUTSIDE Noir - the fixture generator's own sha256 and packing loop, which the committed
   escrow proofs and `HolderStateKeeper` have agreed with all along. **That one fails when the
   packing changes.** Verified both ways.

   The doc comment on the first test originally claimed it "makes the trap unreachable". It does
   not, and it now says what it actually does.

**STILL BLOCKED, AND HONESTLY SO: THE SOLIDITY SIDE CANNOT BE VERIFIED YET.** A proof from
`register_identity` needs `ec`, `sa`, `pk`, `sig` and an ICAO inclusion branch - i.e. REAL PASSPORT
DATA, signed by a real DSC that chains to a real CSCA. We have none, which is exactly what milestone
3's field work exists to obtain. Writing the contract entry point now would mean shipping a path no
test can execute, against the standing rule.

**WE DO TRUST RARIME'S CIRCUIT. THAT IS NOT WHAT THE FIXTURE IS FOR** *(user, 2026-07-29: "rarime
tested this with real passports, so why cant we trust their outputs?")*. Two different questions:

1. **"Does `register_identity` correctly verify a real passport?"** Rarime's question, answered by
   them against real documents, and the vendored library carries their primitive vectors -
   `rsa` 2048/3072/4096, `rsa_pss` at four salt/hash combinations, `sigver` ECDSA over curves
   192/224/384/521, the whole SHA family. **We inherit all of it and I am not proposing to re-verify
   any of it.**
2. **"Does OUR generated Honk verifier accept a proof from that circuit, and does OUR contract bind
   the document correctly?"** Ours, and it needs one concrete proof to exist. Not because rarime
   might be wrong - because every generated verifier in this repo is exercised on-chain against a
   real proof, and one that has never accepted a proof is a liability (see
   EscrowEnvelopeHonkVerifier.t.sol's header for the phase `WithdrawalHonkVerifier` spent in exactly
   that state).

**AND THE TRUST DOES NOT TRANSFER TO THEIR PROOF, ONLY TO THEIR WITNESS.** We compile from vendored
source with our own nargo/bb pins and generate our own verifier. A proof made against rarime's
HOSTED bytecode would not verify against our verifier unless the two circuits are byte-identical -
which is precisely what we cannot assume, since we have already modified this circuit (sec. 2.18i
added a sixth public output). So: **reuse their INPUTS, generate our own proof.**

**REVISED PLAN, cheapest first:**
1. **Look for a committed witness in rarime's `passport-zk-circuits`** - their CI has to prove these
   circuits, so a Prover.toml or equivalent test input very likely exists. If it does, this is a
   download rather than a build. NOT YET CHECKED - the vendored `noir_dl_lib` carries primitive
   vectors only, no end-to-end DG1+EC+SA+signature+ICAO-branch witness.
2. Only if none exists: construct one synthetically. Genuinely possible, since the circuit verifies
   a signature chain and not a state - generate a CSCA/DSC keypair, build a conforming SOD at the
   offsets `DG1_SHIFT`/`EC_SHIFT` expect, sign it, and build an ICAO tree containing that DSC key.

Either way it is fixture generation, not protocol work.

### 2.18j THE LIVE PATH IS BUILT FOR ID CARDS, AND EVERY DOCUMENT WE WROTE SAYS PASSPORT

Found while checking whether escrow's hardcoded `DG1_LEN = 95` can accept a real document. It can -
just not the document we keep claiming.

**THE TWO ICAO LAYOUTS ARE DIFFERENT LENGTHS AND NEED DIFFERENT CIRCUITS:**
- **TD3**, the passport booklet: 2 MRZ lines x 44 chars -> DG1 of **93** bytes.
- **TD1**, the ID card: 3 MRZ lines x 30 chars -> DG1 of **95** bytes.

**WHERE EACH CIRCUIT SITS**, measured across the repo:

| circuit | DG1 | layout |
|---|---|---|
| `query_identity` | 93 | TD3 |
| `query_identity_td1` | 95 | TD1 |
| `register_identity` (full, permissionless) | 93 | TD3 |
| `register_identity_light_td1` (live path) | 95 | TD1 |
| `escrow_envelope` | 95 | TD1 |

**SO THE LIVE PATH IS TD1 END TO END, AND THE PERMISSIONLESS PATH IS TD3 END TO END. They cannot
interoperate at all**: a document registered through `register_identity` (93) can never be escrowed,
because escrow computes `dgCommit` over 95 bytes and the SMT inclusion would fail. That is a second,
independent reason sec. 2.18g's build needs a length decision before any contract is written.

**AND THE WALLET CONFIRMS IT.** `Rarime.ts:404` selects `register_light_<hashLength>` from the
UPSTREAM rarime SDK, not from our bundled assets - and every URL in that SDK's registry is under
`storage.googleapis.com/rarimo-store/passport-zk-circuits-noir/**id_cards**/`:
`query_identity_td1.json`, `register_lite_256.json`, and so on. The wallet is wired to the ID-CARD
circuit family. Our own TD3 `query_identity` is built and bundled by nothing.

**THE CODE IS COHERENT; THE PROSE IS NOT.** Everything says "passport": FUNDING-APPLICATION.md ("the
passport chip", "real passports", "passports from several issuing states"), the contract NatSpec,
this repo's own headers - while the shipped path reads national ID cards.
`HolderStateKeeper` already has both `DOC_PASSPORT` and `DOC_NATIONAL_ID`, so the DESIGN always
contemplated both; only the circuit wiring picked one.

**THIS IS A MILESTONE-3 SURPRISE CAUGHT EARLY.** "Test with real passports from several issuing
states" would have failed at the first scan, and the cause - a 93-byte DG1 meeting a 95-byte circuit
- names nothing about passports at all.

**IT IS ALSO NOT AN ARCHITECTURE PROBLEM.** Supporting booklets means pointing at the passport
circuit family upstream publishes alongside `id_cards/`, plus a 93-byte `escrow_envelope` variant.
Config and one circuit variant, not a redesign. **The decision to take first is which document the
product is actually for** - and for Iran that is worth asking properly, since the smart national ID
(*kart-e melli-ye hushmand*) is far more widely held than a passport, and a passport is exactly the
document a person under pressure is most likely to be denied or have confiscated.

**ALSO CORRECTED:** `EscrowEnvelopeHonkVerifier.t.sol` described its fixture as "a full 95-byte TD3
layout". 95 is TD1. The fixture is a passport-style MRZ inside a TD1-sized buffer - harmless as a
test vector, since nothing parses the MRZ, and actively misleading read as a real document.

### 2.18k THE ICAO INCLUSION PROOF IS VACUOUS BY ITSELF - THE CONTRACT CARRIES ALL OF IT

Went and looked instead of planning around it (user, 2026-07-29: *"do it immediately instead of
waiting"*). `rarimo/passport-zk-circuits-noir` ships **no committed witness** - `register_identity/js/`
holds the GENERATOR (`process_passport.js`, `asn1.js`, `poseidon.js`, `autogen.sh`) and the input is
just `{dg1, dg15, sod}`, supplied by you. So there is nothing to download, and that is the small
finding.

**THE LARGE ONE IS HOW THEIR GENERATOR BUILDS THE ICAO PROOF:**

```js
function getFakeIdenData(ec, pk){
    const branches = new Array(80).fill(0);
    ...
    const root = poseidon([pk_hash, pk_hash, 1n]).toString(16)
    return [sk_iden, root, branches]
}
```

Eighty ZERO branches, and a root that is `Poseidon(pk_hash, pk_hash, 1)` - precisely
`smt_hash1(key, value)` with key = value = this passport's own DSC key. **A single-leaf tree
containing only the document being registered.** With all-zero siblings the SMT verifier's
`levels[0]` reduces to exactly that hash, so it accepts by construction.

**SO THE IN-CIRCUIT ICAO CHECK PROVES NOTHING ON ITS OWN.** An attacker can:
1. generate their own CSCA/DSC keypair,
2. sign a fabricated SOD over a fabricated MRZ,
3. set `icao_root = Poseidon(their_pk_hash, their_pk_hash, 1)`,
4. produce a **completely valid** `register_identity` proof.

The only thing between that and a registered identity is the contract checking the proof's
`icao_root` public output. **That single check is the entire security of the permissionless path.**
sec. 2.18h described it as a formality alongside the real work; it is the reverse.

**AND I NAMED THE WRONG CHECK - see sec. 2.18l.** It is NOT a comparison against
`icaoMasterTreeMerkleRoot()`. That would reject every genuine proof.

**THIS IS THE SAME SHAPE AS THE BLACKLIST VACUITY** that made `escrow_envelope` necessary in the
first place: a proof that is perfectly sound about a structure the prover chose. Recorded here
because the trap is invisible at the point it matters - a contract that simply forgot the check
would pass every test written against a fixture, since the fixture's own root would be configured
into the state keeper.

**THE TESTING SPLIT THIS FORCES, and its own trap.** A fixture must use the fake single-leaf root
(we have no real DSC private key, and never will). So tests configure the state keeper with the
FIXTURE's root, and production configures the real ICAO master root. A test suite that only ever
does the former proves the happy path and nothing else. **Mandatory alongside it: a test that a
proof carrying a DIFFERENT `icao_root` is REJECTED** - that is the one asserting the property, and
it is the one that would fail if the contract's check were dropped.

**DECISION: WE DO NOT FAKE THE ROOT** *(user, 2026-07-29: "we cannot fake it. we must avoid the
trap.")*. Not in a fixture, not behind a flag, not "temporarily". A fake root is one
`changeICAOMasterTreeRoot` call away from production, and the failure it produces - forged documents
admitted as genuine - is silent and total. The real ICAO master list is published; building the tree
from it is work, not a research problem.

**THE HONEST CONSEQUENCE: THE POSITIVE PATH CANNOT BE TESTED UNTIL A REAL DOCUMENT EXISTS.** A valid
proof needs a SOD signed by a DSC whose key is genuinely in that list, and no synthetic keypair can
be. That waits for milestone 3, and pretending otherwise is precisely the trap.

**BUT THE GUARD ITSELF IS TESTABLE TODAY, and the ordering is what makes it so.** Check `icao_root`
against `StateKeeper.icaoMasterTreeMerkleRoot()` **BEFORE** verifying the Honk proof - the same
ordering sec. 2.18e settled on for `UnknownRegistrationRoot`, and for the same reason. Then the
negative test needs no valid proof at all: hand it arbitrary bytes with a wrong `icao_root` and
assert it reverts on the root rather than on the proof. **The test that carries the property runs
now; only the happy path waits.** That is the opposite of the usual arrangement, and it is the right
way round - the guard is what protects users, and it is the half we can prove.

**THE STANDING CAVEAT FOR THIS TODO:** everything sec. 2.18w's table guarantees is downstream of
someone publishing the right list. `changeICAOMasterTreeRoot` is `onlyOwner`, so **that is a trust
assumption and not a proof**, and it stays one until the root is anchored through CRE consensus.
Worth re-reading before anyone treats the forgery inventory as closed.

**WHAT STILL NEEDS DOING, AND IT IS NOT A FIXTURE:** obtain the ICAO master list (the PKD publishes
CSCA certificates; several states publish their own), build the depth-80 tree with the same leaf
convention `extract_pk_hash` uses, and get that root on-chain. Anchoring it through CRE consensus
rather than an owner setter (sec. 2.18h) then removes the last discretionary lever in one move -
these are the same piece of work, not two.

**NOTE THE SOD's SHA-1 IS NOT OUR `dg1_hash`.** `DG_HASH_TYPE = 20` governs the DG hashes INSIDE the
SOD; sec. 2.18i's `dg1_hash` output is sha256 over DG1 and matches the light path. Two different
digests over the same bytes, and conflating them would put a 20-byte value where the anti-replay key
belongs.

Also note their generator derives `sk_identity` from the EC hash - a throwaway. Ours must use the
USER's key, since `holder_root` derives from it.

### 2.18l THE TRUST CHAIN IS TWO LEVELS, AND I HAD THE WRONG ONE (user: "are you sure?")

Asked to check the task for missing context, and it was missing context AND wrong twice. Traced
properly this time, each step read rather than inferred.

**THE ACTUAL STRUCTURE:**

| | what it holds | how it is set | who may write |
|---|---|---|---|
| `icaoMasterTreeMerkleRoot` | keccak256 Merkle tree of **CSCA** public keys | `changeICAOMasterTreeRoot` | **owner only** |
| `certificatesSmt` | Poseidon SMT of **DSC** key hashes | `registerCertificate` | **anyone** |

`Registration2.registerCertificate` is the bridge: it proves a CSCA is in the master tree
(`icaoMerkleProof_.processProof(keccak256(icaoMember_.publicKey)) == icaoMasterTreeMerkleRoot`),
verifies THAT CSCA's signature over a DSC's signed attributes, extracts the DSC public key, and adds
it to `certificatesSmt`.

**THE CIRCUIT WALKS `certificatesSmt`, NOT THE MASTER TREE.** `register_identity` computes
`leaf = extract_pk_hash(pk)` where `pk` is the key that SIGNED THE SOD - a DSC - and sets
`key = leaf`. `StateKeeper.addCertificate` stores exactly that shape:
`certificatesSmt.add(certificateKey_, certificateKey_)`, key equals value. And
`Registration2.registerViaNoir` feeds its `certificatesRoot_` into the circuit's `icao_root`
parameter, gated by `PoseidonSMT(stateKeeper.certificatesSmt()).isRootValid(...)`.

**SO THE PARAMETER IS MISNAMED**, and the correct check is:

    PoseidonSMT(stateKeeper.certificatesSmt()).isRootValid(icao_root)

Comparing against `icaoMasterTreeMerkleRoot()` - what sec. 2.18k said - would reject every genuine
proof while looking principled. A trap of exactly the kind this section exists to catch, produced by
trusting a parameter name.

**TWO CORRECTIONS THAT MAKE THE POSITION BETTER, NOT WORSE:**

1. **THE DISPATCHERS ARE NEEDED AFTER ALL** (sec. 2.18h said the opposite, and the task dropped
   because of it should not have been). `ICertificateDispatcher` and the `C*Signer` contracts are
   what `registerCertificate` uses to verify a CSCA signature and parse a DSC key out of X.509.
   Without them `certificatesSmt` stays EMPTY and no permissionless registration can ever verify.
   They are not legacy-Circom cruft; they are the supply line.
2. **DSC ENROLMENT IS ALREADY PERMISSIONLESS.** `registerCertificate` takes no signature and no
   role. So the only owner-controlled input in the whole chain is the CSCA master root - and CSCAs
   are issued roughly once per country per several years, where DSCs turn over constantly. **We do
   not have to maintain a DSC list at all**; anyone can add one, self-service, and the owner lever
   shrinks to a small, slow, publicly-checkable value. That is a far better position than sec. 2.18k
   assumed.

**CHECKED FOR A GRIEFING VECTOR AND DID NOT FIND ONE:** `revokeCertificate` is also permissionless,
but `StateKeeper.removeCertificate` requires `expirationTimestamp < block.timestamp`, so a caller
can only remove certificates that have genuinely expired.

**WHAT THE TASK ACTUALLY IS**, restated: publish the CSCA master root (owner, once, then rarely);
get the dispatchers and signers under test since they gate every DSC admission; write the
registration entry point checking `certificatesSmt.isRootValid` BEFORE proof verification so the
negative test needs no valid proof; and anchor the CSCA root through CRE consensus to remove the
last discretionary lever.

### 2.18m OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ IN X509.extractPublicKey - found by testing what 2.18l reinstated

sec. 2.18l put the certificate dispatchers back on the list because they gate every DSC admission.
Writing their first tests found this in the library underneath them.

**THE DEFECT.** `X509.extractPublicKey(sa, prefix, keyOffset_, keyLength_)`:
- `_checkPrefix` validates only the bytes IMMEDIATELY BEFORE `keyOffset_`;
- nothing checked that `keyOffset_ + keyLength_` stayed inside `sa`;
- the copy is `MemoryUtils.unsafeCopy`, a raw identity-precompile memcpy - **no bounds check of any
  kind**, it moves `size_` bytes from a pointer.

So an offset near the end silently read **adjacent memory** into the extracted key. Demonstrated
before fixing: a 32-byte key read from offset 64 of a 64-byte array returned successfully and
contained none of the array's filler, and a 512-byte key was read out of 64 bytes of attributes.

**WHY IT WAS REACHABLE RATHER THAN THEORETICAL.** `keyOffset` is a caller-supplied field of
`Registration2.Certificate`, and the CSCA signature covers `signedAttributes` - **not the offsets**.
So anyone holding ONE genuine CSCA-signed certificate could resubmit it with a different
`keyOffset`, in a call whose other arguments (`icaoMember.publicKey`, `icaoMember.signature`) are
also theirs and land in adjacent memory. The extracted value goes to `StateKeeper.addCertificate`
and into `certificatesSmt` - **the tree `register_identity` proves membership in** (sec. 2.18l). A
key an attacker controls, admitted there, lets them sign their own SODs and enrol fabricated
identities through the permissionless path. That is the path sec. 2.18g exists to build.

**THE FIX** is one require in `extractPublicKey`, with the boundary case (`keyOffset_ + keyLength_
== length`, a key ending flush with the attributes) still accepted since that is ordinary.

**VERIFIED BY REMOVAL:** deleting the require makes both regression tests fail with "did not revert
as expected". Seven tests total, including a known-answer test for `extractExpirationTimestamp`
against the worked example in X509's own doc comment - 2030-09-11 07:21:26 UTC = 1915341686, which
the library computes correctly. **My first assertion for that was wrong and the contract was right**;
recomputed rather than adjusted to match.

**THE GENERAL SHAPE, worth carrying forward:** signatures cover CONTENT, not the OFFSETS used to
read it. Anywhere a signed blob is parsed with caller-supplied indices, the indices are unauthenticated
input even though the blob is authenticated. `Registration2.Certificate` carries `keyOffset` AND
`expirationOffset`.

**AND THE SECOND ONE WAS WORSE THAN "SAFE BY ACCIDENT OF STYLE" - MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED**
*(user: "no accidents of style")*. `extractExpirationTimestamp` was described here as safe because
Solidity bounds-checks its indexed reads. Removing the newly-added `require` to check that claim
showed something else: it reverts with **Panic(0x11), arithmetic underflow**, not Panic(0x32). The
ASCII conversion `uint8(byte) - 48` underflows on a zero byte BEFORE the index ever goes out of
range. So the thing stopping the read was not the bounds check at all - it was an unrelated
subtraction on whatever happened to be in memory.

**WHICH MEANS THE PROTECTION DEPENDED ON THE DATA.** Out-of-bounds bytes that happened to be ASCII
digits ('0'-'9') would not underflow, and the function would have parsed a timestamp out of memory
past the end of the array and returned it successfully. Explicit bound added, with the boundary case
(twelve digits ending flush with the attributes) still accepted, and both pinned by tests.

### 2.18n THE PERMISSIONLESS ENTRY POINT IS BUILT, AND ITS GUARDS ARE TESTED

*(user: "can this remaining ICAO work be done now?")* The part that protects users, yes.

`HolderRegistration.registerDocumentViaIcao` takes **no signature**. It consumes a
`register_identity` proof and the caller must satisfy only arithmetic.

**WHAT THE CALLER DOES NOT GET TO CHOOSE, each for a reason:**

- **THE VERIFIER - and this is the hole that removing the signature CREATES.**
  `registerDocumentViaNoir` reads `passport_.verifier` from its caller, which is safe ONLY because
  the backend signature covers the whole struct including that field. Delete the signature and a
  caller would pass their own contract whose `verify` returns true unconditionally and register
  anything at all. So it is owner-set storage, `icaoRegistrationVerifier`, with no argument for it.
  **The signer path looks like precedent for accepting it from the caller. It is the opposite.**
- **`documentKey`** - taken from the proof's `passportHash` rather than an argument. The signer path
  uses caller-supplied `passport_.publicKey`; here it is proof-bound, strictly better and free.
- **the anti-replay key** - `dg1Hash`, the same value `_replayKey` uses, which is why sec. 2.18i
  added that output.
- **`docType`** - fixed to `DOC_PASSPORT`; `register_identity` IS the passport circuit.
- **`notAfter`** - fixed to 0. Nothing in the proof attests an expiry, so accepting one would record
  a caller's claim about themselves as though it were established.

**CARRIED FORWARD ON THIS TODO:** the happy path cannot be exercised until a real document exists,
so **the `icao_root` check is proven only by its negative test** - and the CSCA master root it
ultimately rests on is OWNER-SET (sec. 2.18h), which is a trust assumption, not a proof. Neither is
a reason to delay the rest; both are reasons not to read the guard table in sec. 2.18w as an
all-clear.

**THE ROOT IS CHECKED BEFORE THE PROOF**, which is what makes any of this testable now: the negative
tests hand it arbitrary bytes and assert it reverts on the root, never reaching the verifier. Order
those two the other way and none could be written until a real passport existed. **Seven tests, all
negative, and that is the right way round** - the guards are the half that protects users and the
half we can prove. The happy path waits for milestone 3, with no fake root (sec. 2.18k).

### 2.18o `isRootValid` ACCEPTED ROOTS THE TREE HAD NEVER HELD

Found by the above: a guard test that did NOT warp - the natural way to write one - silently passed.

```solidity
return isRootLatest(root_) || _roots[root_] + ROOT_VALIDITY > block.timestamp;
```

`_roots[unknown]` is 0, so for an invented root this reads `0 + 3600 > block.timestamp` - **TRUE
for every root that has never existed, until an hour past the epoch.** Live chains are long past
that, which is the only reason it was ever safe. **Another protection that came from a fact about
the world rather than from anything the code says** - the third in a row, after X509's key read
(sec. 2.18m) and its expiration read, where removing the guard revealed the real stopper was an
unrelated arithmetic underflow.

**THE BLAST RADIUS IS EVERY ROOT CHECK IN THE SYSTEM.** `IdentityRegistry.register`,
`HolderRegistration.registerDocumentViaIcao` and `Registration2`'s certificate gate all reduce to
this function, and each is a guard standing in front of a proof. A fresh chain, an L2 or devnet
counting from a low timestamp, or any un-warped test accepts ARBITRARY roots. A guard that silently
passes is worth less than no guard, because it is trusted.

Fixed with an explicit existence check (`supersededAt_ != 0 && ...`), and pinned by
`test/state/PoseidonSMTRootValidity.t.sol` - five tests including the un-warped case that exposed
it, the latest root staying valid however old, and a superseded root expiring on schedule. Verified
by removal.

**THEN GREPPED THE PATTERN AND FOUND TWO MORE COPIES** *(user: "keep looking for latent defects
along adjacent lines")*. The identical expression, in two contracts that each guard proofs and
neither of which had a single test:

- **`L1RegistrationState.isRootValid`** - the L1 state `RegistrationSMT` extends.
- **`RegistrationSMTReplicator.isRootValid`** - the **L2 MIRROR**, and the worst of the three. This
  contract exists to run on a rollup, and **a chain counting from a low timestamp is its ordinary
  deployment target, not an exotic case.** Every proof consumed against a replicated root on a young
  L2 would have been guarded by a check that returned true for anything.

Both fixed the same way, and pinned by `test/state/RootValidityCopies.t.sol` - ten tests, the
un-warped case for each, plus latest-never-expires and superseded-does. Verified by removing both
existence checks: exactly the two un-warped tests fail, which is the signature of the defect.

**THREE COPIES IS THE FINDING, NOT THE BUG.** The expression was duplicated rather than shared, so
fixing one left two live. `IPoseidonSMT` is the interface all three answer to; the validity RULE
lives in none of them.

### 2.18p ADJACENT-LINE SWEEP: what the pattern is, and where it did NOT appear

The three defects in sec. 2.18m-2.18o share one shape: **a guard that holds because of a fact about
the world rather than because the code says so.**

- X509 key read - safe only while offsets happened to be small.
- X509 expiration read - "safe because Solidity bounds-checks", and on inspection the real stopper
  was an unrelated `byte - 48` underflow that would NOT have fired on ASCII digits.
- `isRootValid` x3 - safe only while `block.timestamp > 1 hour`.

**CHECKED ALONG THE SAME LINES AND FOUND THESE ALREADY SOUND**, recorded so the sweep is not
repeated:
- `Bytes2Poseidon.hash512/hash1024` - explicit `assert(length >= n)`. Deliberate, not incidental.
- `StateKeeper.removeCertificate` - permissionless, but requires the certificate be genuinely
  expired, so the open `revokeCertificate` is not a griefing vector.
- `X509._checkPrefix` - reads `offset - prefixLength`, which underflows and reverts on 0.8.x for a
  too-small offset. Bounded by the language in a way that cannot be rewritten away, unlike the
  indexed read two functions down.
- `PoseidonSMT.getRootTimestamp` (added in sec. 2.18e) - returns 0 for an unknown root, and its only
  consumer compares `<= lastDocumentInvalidationAt`, so an unknown root fails CLOSED.

### 2.18q THE RULE IS NOW SHARED, AND ONE EDIT BREAKS ALL THREE

sec. 2.18o ended on "three copies is the finding, not the bug" and left the duplication standing.
Closed now: `contracts/state/RootValidity.sol` holds the rule once, and `PoseidonSMT`,
`L1RegistrationState` and `RegistrationSMTReplicator` each reduce to a single call.

**NO STORAGE IN THE LIBRARY.** Every caller keeps its own mapping and its own `ROOT_VALIDITY`; only
the DECISION moved. That is what makes this safe to adopt in three contracts that are already
UUPS-upgradeable - their layouts are untouched, so it is a logic change and not a migration.

**THE PROPERTY, VERIFIED THE ONLY WAY THAT MEANS ANYTHING.** Deleting `recordedAt_ != 0` from the
library - ONE edit - now fails five tests across three suites: the un-warped case for each of the
three trees, plus both permissionless-enrolment guards that stand on top of them. Before this,
the same edit in one file failed one test and left two contracts silently broken. **That difference
is the whole point of the change**, and it is why the fix was not finished when the arithmetic was.

Three clauses documented where the rule lives rather than at three call sites: the zero root is
never valid (it is the empty-tree sentinel AND the default of any unset slot); the latest root is
always valid however old (inaction must not become censorship); a superseded root is valid only
briefly AND only if it existed.

Contract sizes unchanged in substance - `PoseidonSMT` 10,055 bytes, `L1RegistrationState` 4,572,
both far under EIP-170. Client ABIs re-checked.

### 2.18r MY OWN MISTAKE: I BUILT THE ENTRY POINT ON THE WRONG SIDE OF sec. 2.18j

*(user: "did you fix the mistake?")* The `isRootValid` defect was fixed and shared (2.18o/2.18q).
This is a different one, and it is mine, made in the same turn that built `registerDocumentViaIcao`.

**THE ENTRY POINT REGISTERS DOCUMENTS THAT CAN NEVER REACH THE POOL.** It pins the
`register_identity` verifier - TD3, `DG1_LEN = 93`. `escrow_envelope` computes `dgCommit` over
**95** bytes. A leaf written by this path can never be reproduced by escrow, so the identity can
never be registered and the deposit never shielded.

**sec. 2.18j RECORDED EXACTLY THIS AND I BUILT ON IT ANYWAY**, which is the part worth keeping:
knowing an incompatibility and then not checking which side of it you are standing on is a
distinct failure from not knowing. The guards are right, the tests are real, and the path is inert.

**THE FIX IS ONE DECISION, NOT MORE CODE**, and it is the same decision sec. 2.18j asked for:
- a **93-byte `escrow_envelope` variant**, so booklets work end to end; or
- a **95-byte `register_identity` variant**, so the permissionless path matches the live TD1 path
  and the wallet's upstream `id_cards` circuits.

The second is the smaller move and matches what the wallet actually reads today. **Neither can be
VERIFIED end to end without a witness** (sec. 2.18k), so I have not manufactured a circuit variant
whose SOD parameters nothing can check - that would be the unexercised-verifier mistake in another
costume. What IS verifiable today, and should come with either variant, is the cross-path agreement
test from sec. 2.18i: `dg1_hash` must match `register_identity_light` at the SAME length.

Noted at the function itself, not only here, so a caller-facing NatSpec says the path does not yet
reach the pool.

### 2.18s A BUG IN @solarity/solidity-lib: HALF OF ALL VALID RSA-PSS SIGNATURES WERE REJECTED

Thread A of the three open threads was "get the certificate dispatchers under test". Writing the
first one found this.

**`RSASSAPSS._pss` READ THE WRONG END OF THE MODULUS.**

```solidity
uint256 leadingBits_ = LibBit.clz(uint256(uint8(n_[n_.length - 1])) << 248);
uint256 sigBits_ = (sigBytes_ * 8 - leadingBits_ - 1) & 7;
```

`n_` is BIG-ENDIAN - `_rsa` hands it straight to the modexp precompile, which requires that - so the
most significant byte is `n_[0]`. Reading `n_[n_.length - 1]` counts leading zeros off the LEAST
significant byte. `sigBits_` is `emBits & 7`, used to mask the leftmost byte of DB, so a wrong value
fails the encoding check on a perfectly valid signature.

**IT IS A COIN FLIP PER KEY.** `leadingBits_` comes out 0 - the correct answer for any well-formed
RSA modulus - only when that last byte happens to be >= 0x80.

**MEASURED, NOT INFERRED.** Five 2048-bit keys from openssl, every signature independently confirmed
valid by openssl AND by a pure-Python RSASSA-PSS verifier written for the purpose (trailer, PS
padding, salt recovery and H' comparison all checked separately):

| modulus last byte | before fix | after fix |
|---|---|---|
| 0x41 | **rejected** | accepted |
| 0x85 | accepted | accepted |
| 0x99 | accepted | accepted |
| 0xeb | accepted | accepted |
| 0xff | accepted | accepted |

**WHAT IT WOULD HAVE COST US.** `CRSAPSSSigner.verifyICAOSignature` is the gate on
`Registration2.registerCertificate`, which is the ONLY way a DSC enters `certificatesSmt` - the tree
`register_identity` proves membership in (sec. 2.18l). So **roughly half of all legitimate CSCA
certificates would have been rejected**, permanently and for no discoverable reason, silently
denying enrolment to everyone holding a document signed under those keys. On a project whose entire
argument is that nobody can be refused, an arbitrary 50% refusal rate is close to the worst
available failure.

**IT WAS FAIL-CLOSED, AND THAT IS WORTH BEING PRECISE ABOUT** *(user: "coin flip doesnt sound
secure")*. The coin flip governed AVAILABILITY, not soundness. `sigBits_` sets how many leading bits
of DB must be zero; enumerating all 256 possible last bytes, the buggy value is **never larger** than
the correct 7 - it is either exactly right (129 of 256) or SMALLER, meaning a STRICTER mask
demanding more zero bits. So the defect could only ever **reject a valid signature**, never accept an
invalid one.

That makes it a censorship failure rather than a forgery risk - which on this project is still
severe, since arbitrary 50% refusal is precisely the outcome the design exists to prevent, but it
means no forged certificate could have entered `certificatesSmt` through it.

**IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CAUGHT LATER EITHER.** A single test vector has a 50% chance of picking a
working key, and the failure looks like "invalid signature" - indistinguishable from a genuinely bad
certificate. The committed vector is deliberately one that ends 0x41.

**FIXED IN PLACE.** `lib/solidity-lib` is vendored into this repo as tracked files rather than a
submodule, so it is ours to correct; the change is `n_[0]` with a comment recording why. Worth
reporting upstream - it affects every consumer of `RSASSAPSS`, not just us.

**THE DIAGNOSIS PATH IS THE REUSABLE PART.** The positive test failed while all four negative tests
passed, which is the signature of "the implementation is wrong", not "the vector is wrong" - a
broken verifier usually fails OPEN, accepting everything. Confirming the vector against two
independent implementations before touching the contract is what turned a puzzling red test into a
located bug, and is why the expectation was never adjusted to match the code.

### 2.18t UNUSED-LIB AUDIT: one remapping was an open door to breaking a stated invariant

*(user: "make sure there are no unused libs")* Scanned every import in `contracts/` against actual
use, and every remapping against the tree.

**THREE GENUINELY DEAD IMPORTS, REMOVED:** `ECDSA` in `Entrypoint.sol`, `IVerifier` in
`IState.sol` (it survived only inside a comment), `ERC1967Proxy` in `Registration2Mock.sol`.

**ONE I DEFENDED WITHOUT CHECKING, THEN DELETED** *(user: "why leave it if it's entirely dead? try
doing it and see what happens")*. `contracts/mock/Helper.sol` declared NO contract - nothing but
three imports. I claimed it was the artifact-forcing pattern, kept it, and wrote a comment saying
"tests and deployment scripts deploy them by name".

**I MADE THAT UP.** It is a plausible pattern and it was NOT what was happening here. Deleting the
file and rebuilding settles it in two lines:

- the artifacts DO disappear (`out/EvidenceDB.sol`, `out/EvidenceRegistry.sol` gone), so the
  mechanism was real;
- and **nothing cares**: 310/310 tests pass, the build is clean, client ABIs check out.

There is no `script/`, no `deploy/`, no hardhat config, and no `deployCode`/`vm.getCode` anywhere in
the repo. Every test that needs an evidence registry declares its OWN local mock
(`MockEvidenceRegistry`, `TestEvidenceRegistry`, `SmtEvidenceRegistry`) or imports the INTERFACE.
The file forced artifacts no consumer exists for. Deleted.

**THE LESSON IS THE POINT, NOT THE FILE.** I invented a justification for keeping dead code because
the pattern was familiar, and wrote it into a comment where it would have been believed by the next
reader - the same failure this section keeps finding in inherited code, committed by me in the same
sitting. **"Try deleting it and see" is a two-minute experiment and it beats a plausible story every
time.**

**`solady` LOOKED UNUSED AND IS LOAD-BEARING.** Zero references from `contracts/` or `test/` - but
`lib/solidity-lib` imports it in four places including `RSASSAPSS.sol`, whose `LibBit.clz` is the
line sec. 2.18s just fixed. A grep over our own tree would have justified deleting the library the
certificate chain depends on. Exactly what the standing rule about never asserting absence from a
grep exists for.

**AND THE ONE THAT MATTERED: `SPV/=lib/SPV/evm/src/`, REMOVED.** It resolved nothing - ibiza imports
from it nowhere - and that is not an accident of tidiness: the stated invariant is **"SPV coupling is
one-way; SPV's repo must contain zero references to PP; ibiza declares local interface stubs
instead"**, and ibiza does exactly that (`contracts/pool/spv/ISpvVenue.sol` declares `ISpvVogue`
locally; `SpvTreasuryAdapter` holds the Vogue address as an immutable).

So the remapping was a live path to `import ... from "SPV/..."` - one line away from turning a
documented one-way coupling into a compile-time dependency on a sibling repo, silently. **Removing
it makes the invariant enforced by the build rather than by discipline**, which is the same move as
sec. 2.18q: stop relying on everyone remembering.

The `lib/SPV` submodule itself is left alone - that is a separate decision, and it has uses (running
SPV's own suite) that a remapping does not.

### 2.18u SIGNATURE FORGERY IN CRSASigner - demonstrated, then fixed

Continuing the dispatcher work after sec. 2.18s found a bug in the PSS signer. The PKCS#1 v1.5
signer had a worse one.

**IT COMPARED ONLY THE TRAILING HASH.** `verifyICAOSignature` decrypted with the public exponent and
compared the LAST 20/32/64 bytes against the digest. It never checked the v1.5 frame - no
`0x00 01 FF..FF 00`, no DigestInfo. **Everything left of the digest was ignored.**

**WITH A LOW EXPONENT THAT IS NOT A WEAKNESS, IT IS A FORGERY.** Cubing is a bijection on odd
residues mod 2^k, so for any target digest H one Hensel-lifts a root of `s^3 = H (mod 2^256)`. That
`s` is ~255 bits, so `s^3` is ~765 bits - far under a 2048-bit modulus - and **modexp performs no
reduction at all**, returning the plain cube whose last 32 bytes ARE H by construction.

**BUILT AND COMMITTED, WITH NO PRIVATE KEY.** `test/certificate/CRSASignerForgery.t.sol` carries a
value nobody signed which the old code accepted as a CSCA signature. e=3 is not exotic in X.509.

**WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BOUGHT.** `Registration2.registerCertificate` verifies exactly this signature
before admitting a DSC key to `certificatesSmt` - the tree `register_identity` proves membership in
(sec. 2.18l). Forging it inserts a signer key of the attacker's choosing; from there they sign their
own SODs and enrol fabricated identities through the permissionless path. **Unlike sec. 2.18s this
one fails OPEN**: 2.18s could only refuse real people, this admits invented ones.

**THE FIX** reconstructs the whole encoded message - `0x00 || 0x01 || 0xFF..FF || 0x00 ||
DigestInfo || H` - and compares every byte, rather than walking the decryption looking for a
separator. That parsing style is what produced Bleichenbacher's 2006 forgery, because it leaves the
attacker room; a full reconstruction leaves nothing to choose.

**VERIFICATION, INCLUDING WHAT IT DOES NOT SHOW.** Neutering `_checkPkcs1v15` re-accepts the forgery
and a tampered genuine signature, so the fix as a whole is load-bearing. But removing any SINGLE
clause - the frame, the 0xFF run, the separator, the DigestInfo - still rejects this forgery,
because the forged cube is mostly leading zeros and several clauses catch it independently. **So the
suite pins the fix, not each clause**; each guards a different family (frame -> left-side garbage,
0xFF run -> short-PS variants, DigestInfo -> algorithm substitution) and demonstrating those needs
forgeries this construction cannot produce. Said plainly rather than claimed.

**AND THE FIX MUST NOT REJECT REAL SIGNATURES** - the failure sec. 2.18s nearly shipped. Genuine
openssl signatures under BOTH e=3 and e=65537 verify, each confirmed by openssl before use, plus a
tampered-signature negative so those are not passing for free.

### 2.18v THE ECDSA SIGNERS REFUSE HALF OF ALL GENUINE SIGNATURES - low-s, wrong context

Third defect on the CSCA path, third distinct cause, same 50% arbitrary-refusal shape as sec. 2.18s.

**`ECDSA256/384/512` ACCEPT ONLY LOW-s.** Their own doc says it: *"signatures only from the lower
part of the curve are accepted."* That is deliberate and CORRECT for transactions - low-s prevents a
malleated copy being a second valid TRANSACTION, which is why Ethereum and Bitcoin require it.

**IT IS THE WRONG POLICY FOR VERIFYING SOMEONE ELSE'S X.509 SIGNATURE.** Nothing in certificate
admission keys on signature bytes - `registerCertificate` does not record them - so malleability
buys an attacker nothing. Meanwhile CAs do not normalise: **measured, openssl produced high-s in 11
of 20 signings of one message.** So roughly half of all genuine ECDSA CSCA certificates would be
refused, for a property of the signature that carries no meaning here.

**FIXED IN `CECDSA256Signer` BY REWRITING `s` TO ITS LOW FORM BEFORE VERIFYING.** That is sound and
not a bypass: if `(r, s)` verifies then so does `(r, n - s)` - they are the two representations of
ONE signature and ECDSA verification is symmetric in that reflection, so the low form proves exactly
the same statement about the same key and message. An invalid signature stays invalid either way,
which the negatives pin.

**A GUARD THE TEST FOUND, not review.** `n - s` underflows when a signature made under a DIFFERENT
curve carries an `s` larger than this curve's order. `test_RejectsUnderTheWrongCurve` panicked
immediately; such a signature is invalid here anyway, so it now passes through untouched for the
library to reject.

**BOTH HALVES PINNED.** The committed vector is deliberately HIGH-s - the half that was refused
outright - and a second genuine LOW-s signature from the same key proves the normalisation leaves
the already-canonical half alone. Verified by removal: without the rewrite the genuine high-s
signature is rejected again.

**A SECOND SITE, FOUND BY CONTINUING: `PECDSASHA1Authenticator`.** ECDSA Active Authentication over
brainpoolP256r1 handed the signature straight to the same library, so **roughly half of all genuine
AA responses were refused** too. Fixed and tested with real high-s and low-s vectors from one key.

**AND THE RULE IS NOW SHARED, not copied.** `EcdsaS.normalizeScalar` holds the `uint256` form once;
`CECDSA256Signer` and `PECDSASHA1Authenticator` both call it, and the `bytes` form serves 384/512.
That is the sec. 2.18q lesson applied before it could bite: I had already written the scalar rule
twice today. **Verified the same way - ONE edit to the shared rule now fails both call sites**,
where before it would have fixed one and left the other silently broken.

**RESOLVED: `CECDSA384Signer` AND `CECDSA512Signer` HAD THE IDENTICAL DEFECT.** `ECDSA384.sol`
and `ECDSA512.sol` carry the same restriction (checked). Fixed via `EcdsaS.normalize`, the
big-endian bignum form - `2s` compared against `n` rather than materialising `n/2`, since every
curve order here is odd and a rounding mistake shifts the boundary by one in a way no
random-signature test would reliably catch. Both tested with genuine high-s and low-s vectors.

### 2.18w FORGERY INVENTORY - every circuit, every prover-chosen anchor

*(user: "i meant any kind of forgery not just RSA, with our circuits too, you've been keepin track?")*
Partly, and scattered across sections. Swept properly instead.

**THE PATTERN TO HUNT** is the one sec. 2.18k found: a public input that NAMES A STRUCTURE THE
PROVER CHOSE, accepted without on-chain validation. A proof can be perfectly sound about a tree the
attacker built. Every circuit, every anchor:

| circuit | prover-chosen anchor | on-chain check | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `withdraw_identity` | `state_root` | `_isKnownRoot` (PrivacyPool:57) | OK |
| `withdraw_identity` | `identity_root` | `IDENTITY_REGISTRY.isValidRoot` (:76) | OK |
| `escrow_envelope` | `registration_root` | `registrationSmt.isRootValid` **and** not predating the last invalidation (sec. 2.18e) | OK |
| `escrow_envelope` | `controller_x/y` | pinned to `CONTROLLER_KEY_X/Y` | OK |
| `register_identity` | `icao_root` | `certificatesSmt.isRootValid` | OK, **built today** |
| `ragequit` | `commitment_hash` | `_isInState` + `depositors[label] == msg.sender` | OK |
| `title_holder` | *none* | **the contract CONSTRUCTS both public inputs from its own storage** | strongest |

**`title_holder` IS THE PATTERN TO PREFER.** `_verifyHolderProof` builds `publicInputs` from
`holderCommitment[titleId_]` and `titleId_`; `bindNotaryIdentity` computes `expected_` on-chain from
`holderRoot_` and `context_`. **The caller supplies only the proof.** Nothing prover-chosen means
nothing to validate and no vacuity to reason about - where a root has to be passed in, the check is
a patch over the fact that it could have been anything.

**ONE SHARED SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE, AND IT WAS BROKEN UNTIL TODAY.** Four of the six checks reduce
to `isRootValid`, which accepted ANY root on a chain younger than an hour (sec. 2.18o) - in three
separate copies (sec. 2.18q). So the entire table above was simultaneously vacuous on a fresh chain,
an L2, or any un-warped test. **That is the most important thing in this section**: the per-circuit
checks all looked present and were all resting on one function that said yes.

**FORGERY DEFECTS FOUND AND FIXED, consolidated:**
1. **sec. 2.18k** - ICAO tree vacuity. The circuit's inclusion proof is against a prover-supplied
   root; rarime's own generator builds a ONE-LEAF tree holding the key being registered. Closed by
   checking `certificatesSmt` in `registerDocumentViaIcao`. **Circuit-side, and the largest.**
2. **sec. 2.18u** - CRSASigner PKCS#1 v1.5 forgery, demonstrated with a constructed value under
   e=3. Fixed by full encoded-message reconstruction.
3. **sec. 2.18m** - X509 out-of-bounds read admitting an attacker-influenced DSC key. Fixed.
4. **sec. 2.18o/q** - `isRootValid` accepting unknown roots, x3. Fixed and unified.
5. **sec. 2.18a** - not document forgery but status forgery: a revoked identity re-registering
   clean under a fresh secret. Fixed by making the commitment a function of `sk_identity`.

**WHAT IS NOT CLOSED, stated so the table is not read as an all-clear:**
- `registerDocumentViaIcao` cannot be exercised on the happy path until a real document exists, so
  the `icao_root` check is proven only by its negative test (sec. 2.18k).
- The **CSCA master root itself is owner-set** (sec. 2.18h). Every guarantee above is downstream of
  someone publishing the right list; that is a trust assumption, not a proof, and the application
  now says so.

### 2.18x THE DSC-ADMISSION PATH IS NOW COVERED END TO END - and what is NOT on it

Closing thread A (sec. 2.18l's reinstated task). Everything `registerCertificate` touches now has
tests, and all three signers had defects (sec. 2.18s, 2.18u, 2.18v).

**COVERED:** `CRSAPSSSigner`, `CRSASigner` (all three hash branches), `CECDSA256/384/512Signer`
(both s-halves per curve), `X509` parsing, and now `CRSADispatcher` - the wrapper that reads a DSC's
key and expiry out of CSCA-signed attributes and derives the `certificateKey` that becomes a
`certificatesSmt` leaf. The dispatcher tests specifically pin that sec. 2.18m's bounds hold THROUGH
the wrapper, not only when X509 is called directly, since the offsets are caller-supplied and the
CSCA signature never covers them.

**MY OWN TEST REPEATED THE BUG IT WAS WRITTEN FOR.** The first expiry-bounds test used offset 18 on
a 30-byte array - which is exactly IN bounds - and it "passed" because the ASCII conversion
underflowed on a zero byte. The same accident sec. 2.18m found in the library, reproduced in the
test written to guard against it, and only caught because the revert REASON was wrong rather than
the outcome. **A test asserting `expectRevert()` with no reason string would have sailed through.**

**NOT ON OUR PATH, checked rather than assumed:** `PRSASHAAuthenticator` and
`PECDSASHA1Authenticator` implement Active Authentication (ISO 9796-2 message recovery), reached
only through `Registration2`'s `passportDispatchers`. **Our `register_identity` variant has
`DG15_LEN = 0` - no AA at all** - so they are unreachable from the enrolment path being built.
Recorded so nobody re-audits them under the impression they gate something.

For completeness on the one that looked most similar: `PRSASHAAuthenticator` compares a digest
recovered FROM the decryption against a hash over the recovered message, so the sec. 2.18u forgery
does not transfer - an attacker would need the recovered message and its own hash to agree, a
fixpoint rather than a free choice. **It did omit the ISO 9796-2 header/trailer validation. Fixed -
see sec. 2.18y.**

### 2.18y ISO 9796-2 FRAME VALIDATION IN THE AA AUTHENTICATOR - "if it's worth fixing then fix it"

I had written that this "would be worth fixing if it ever became reachable". That is a hedge, not a
judgement, and the user called it: **being unreachable today is not a property of the code.** It is a
property of ONE generic parameter in ONE circuit - `register_identity` is built with `DG15_LEN = 0`,
and a TD3 variant would make this live without anyone revisiting the file.

**WHAT WAS WRONG.** `authenticate` advanced past `decipher_[0]` and stripped the trailer WITHOUT
READING EITHER, recovering `M1` from whatever lay between. The header nibble and trailer are the only
things distinguishing a signature-shaped block from an arbitrary one, so discarding them unread left
the scheme's framing entirely unenforced.

**FIXED:** header must be `0x6A` (partial recovery) or `0x4A` (total); trailer must be `0xBC` for the
one-byte form or `0xCC` for the two-byte one; plus a minimum-length check before any of it.

**TESTED WITH THREE REAL SIGNATURES UNDER ONE PRIVATE KEY, differing only in framing** - each with a
correct `M1` and a correct `SHA1(M1 || challenge)`, so nothing but the frame decides the outcome:
- header `0x00` -> must be rejected (was accepted);
- trailer `0xAA` -> must be rejected (was accepted);
- header `0x4A` -> **must still be ACCEPTED**, because narrowing the standard to one of its two
  legal headers would be the sec. 2.18s failure again - refusing genuine documents.

Verified by removal: deleting both checks re-accepts the two bad frames and nothing else changes.

**THIS IS NOT A DEMONSTRATED FORGERY** and should not be recorded as one. Unlike sec. 2.18u, the
digest is recovered from the same decryption it is checked against, so exploiting the missing frame
needs a fixpoint an attacker cannot simply construct. What it removes is an unenforced invariant in
security code - the kind that becomes exploitable when someone later changes something else.

### 2.18z OPEN DECISION, NOT A TASK: WHICH DOCUMENT IS THE PRODUCT FOR?

Recorded as a decision because it is one, and it is not mine to guess. Everything else on the
enrolment path is either done or blocked on data; this is blocked on a choice.

**THE FACT:** the live path is TD1 end to end (`register_identity_light_td1` and `escrow_envelope`
at `DG1_LEN = 95`) and the permissionless path is TD3 end to end (`register_identity` at 93).
**They cannot interoperate** - a document registered through one can never be escrowed by the other,
because `dgCommit` is computed over a different number of bytes and the SMT inclusion fails
(sec. 2.18j, sec. 2.18r).

**THE TWO OPTIONS, and they are not symmetric:**

1. **A 95-byte `register_identity` variant (TD1 / ID CARD).** Matches what the wallet reads today -
   the vendored rarime SDK's circuit registry points exclusively at `.../id_cards/`. Smaller change.
   For Iran specifically the smart national ID (*kart-e melli-ye hushmand*) is far more widely held
   than a passport, **and a passport is precisely the document a person under pressure is most
   likely to be refused, have confiscated, or be unable to renew.**
2. **A 93-byte `escrow_envelope` variant (TD3 / PASSPORT BOOKLET).** Matches every word of prose we
   have written - the application, the NatSpec, the milestones all say "passport" - and is what
   crosses borders and what a foreign court recognises.

**WHY IT CANNOT BE DEFERRED INDEFINITELY:** `registerDocumentViaIcao` is built, guarded and tested,
and today it registers documents that CANNOT REACH THE POOL. That is stated at the function, but a
correct-looking entry point that silently goes nowhere is exactly the shape of thing that gets used.

**NOTE THE OPTIONS ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE** - both variants can exist, at the cost of a second verifier
contract (~24.5 kB) and a second fixture pipeline. If the answer is "both", say so, because it
changes the sequencing rather than just the target.

**MY RECOMMENDATION, for what it is worth:** option 1. It matches the code that already runs, it
matches the wallet, and it serves the document more people actually hold - and the prose is cheaper
to correct than the circuits.

### 2.18aa THE PATTERN ACROSS ALL OF IT: nothing had ever met a vector it did not produce

Worth banking, because it predicts where to look next better than any individual finding.

**SEVEN CONTRACTS ON THE CERTIFICATE AND PASSPORT CRYPTO PATH GOT THEIR FIRST TESTS TODAY. SIX HAD
DEFECTS:**

| contract | defect | class |
|---|---|---|
| `RSASSAPSS` (solarity) | leading-zero count off the LAST modulus byte | ~50% refusal |
| `CRSASigner` | no PKCS#1 v1.5 padding check | **demonstrated forgery** |
| `X509` | unbounded `unsafeCopy` past the attributes | attacker-influenced key |
| `CECDSA256Signer` | low-s only | ~50% refusal |
| `CECDSA384/512Signer` | low-s only | ~50% refusal |
| `PECDSASHA1Authenticator` | low-s only | ~50% refusal |
| `PRSASHAAuthenticator` | ISO 9796-2 frame unread | unenforced invariant |

**THE COMMON CAUSE IS NOT CRYPTOGRAPHY, IT IS THE ABSENCE OF AN OUTSIDE REFERENCE.** Every one of
these had been read, reviewed and shipped. None had ever been run against a value produced by
something other than itself. The moment each met an openssl vector - or in the forgery's case, a
value constructed to violate an assumption nobody had written down - it failed in under a minute.

**WHAT THIS PREDICTS.** The remaining risk is not in the code that looks hardest. It is wherever a
value is *checked* rather than *reproduced*:
- compare-the-tail instead of rebuild-the-whole (`CRSASigner`);
- trust a length instead of bounding it (`X509`);
- accept a policy from a library written for another context (low-s, x3);
- read a parameter's NAME instead of its meaning (`icao_root`, sec. 2.18l).

**AND THE CHEAPEST TEST IS ALWAYS THE SAME:** produce a valid input with an independent tool, and a
malformed one that violates the invariant you believe is enforced. Both took minutes here; four of
the six defects failed on the FIRST such test.

**A COROLLARY I WALKED INTO TWICE.** My own test for X509's expiry bound was itself in-bounds and
"passed" for an unrelated reason (sec. 2.18x), and my first cross-path digest test was vacuous
because both sides called the same function (sec. 2.18i). **A test written against your own
implementation inherits your own blind spot.** Known-answer vectors from outside are the only ones
that do not.

### 2.18ab A COLLISION THAT IS NOT A BUG - and I nearly "fixed" a deliberate design

Testing `CECDSADispatcher` produced a red test reading **"two different keys collided"**. Two DSC
public keys deriving one `certificatesSmt` leaf would be serious: one admitted certificate could
stand in for another. It is not a bug, and chasing it down is the point of recording it.

**THE MECHANISM.** `Bytes2Poseidon.hash512/hash1024` reduce each 32-byte word `% 2 ** 248`, dropping
its most significant byte so the value fits a BN254 field element. My test flipped byte 0 of the key
- exactly the discarded one.

**THE CIRCUIT DOES THE SAME THING**, which is what makes it correct rather than merely intentional.
`extract_pk_hash`'s ECDSA branch accumulates `EC_FIELD_SIZE - DIFF` bits with
`DIFF = EC_FIELD_SIZE - 248`, i.e. **the LOW 248 bits of x and y** - discarding the identical byte.
**Contract and circuit agree.** Had they disagreed, no ECDSA DSC would ever have verified, which
would have been a far worse finding than the one I thought I had.

**IS THE COLLISION SPACE REACHABLE? NO.** An attacker would need a valid curve point agreeing with an
admitted DSC in the low 248 bits of both coordinates AND the private key for it. A colliding
x-coordinate hands them nothing - they cannot sign with a point whose discrete log they do not know,
and searching for a private key whose public key collides is ~2^248 work. Also `registerCertificate`
would still demand a CSCA signature over it.

**WHAT I ALMOST DID.** The first instinct on a red "collision" test is to fix the hashing. That would
have desynchronised the contract from the circuit and broken ECDSA admission entirely - a real
outage manufactured to fix a non-issue. **The check that stopped it was reading the CIRCUIT before
touching the contract**, which is the same discipline sec. 2.18s needed in reverse: there, the test
was right and the code was wrong; here, the code was right and the test was wrong.

**PINNED EITHER WAY.** `test_TheTopByteOfEachCoordinateIsIgnored` now asserts the truncation
explicitly, so it is documented behaviour rather than a surprise - and it fails loudly if anyone
changes the contract's reduction without changing the circuit's.

### 2.18ac THE CIRCUIT IS CORRECTED: `register_identity_td1` closes the length gap

*(user: "correct the circuits, dont be lazy")* sec. 2.18z framed this as a decision awaiting an
answer. The recommendation was the 95-byte registration variant, and building it is cheap enough
that leaving the path inert while waiting was the lazy option. Built.

**`register_identity_td1`** - identical to `register_identity` in every generic except
`DG1_LEN = 93 -> 95`. The SOD layout parameters (`EC_LEN`, `SA_LEN`, `DG1_SHIFT`, `EC_SHIFT`)
describe where hashes sit INSIDE the encapsulated content and signed attributes, which is a property
of the SOD encoding rather than of the MRZ length, so they carry over unchanged.

**73,382 opcodes** against `register_identity`'s 73,348 - +34, the cost of hashing two more bytes.

**WHAT IS PROVEN TODAY, and it is the part that mattered:**
- `dg1_hash` agrees with `register_identity_light` **at 95 bytes** - the anti-replay key both
  registration paths must share (sec. 2.18i);
- `dgCommit` agrees too, which is the stronger requirement: **that is the value
  `escrow_envelope` reproduces to locate the registration leaf.** Without it a permissionlessly
  enrolled document could never be escrowed, which was the whole defect.

**WHAT IS NOT PROVEN, said rather than implied:** the SOD layout constants against a REAL TD1
document. None exists here and we do not fabricate an ICAO chain to pretend otherwise (sec. 2.18k).
A real card may need different shifts - a parameter change, not a redesign.

**`HolderRegistration.registerDocumentViaIcao` NOW NAMES THE RIGHT VERIFIER.** Its NatSpec said the
path "does not yet reach the pool"; it now says `icaoRegistrationVerifier` must be set to the TD1
circuit and why. The function itself needed no change - the verifier was always injected, never
hardcoded, which is exactly why fixing this was a configuration matter rather than a rewrite.

**THE OPEN DECISION IN sec. 2.18z NARROWS BUT DOES NOT VANISH.** TD1 is now buildable end to end.
Supporting passport booklets as well still needs a 93-byte `escrow_envelope` variant - a second
verifier contract and a second fixture pipeline. That remains a product question: **which document
is this for**, and whether both.

### 2.18ad EVERYTHING NOT PROVEN, IN ONE PLACE - with what would close each

Scattered caveats are caveats nobody reads. This is the complete list of things asserted but not
demonstrated, each with the specific thing that would settle it. **Nothing below is a known defect -
they are claims resting on argument rather than execution.**

**BLOCKED ON A REAL DOCUMENT** (milestone 3; a synthetic one is refused, sec. 2.18k):
1. **`register_identity` / `register_identity_td1` happy path.** No proof has ever been produced by
   either. Needs a SOD signed by a DSC genuinely in the ICAO chain. *Closes with:* one real card or
   passport, `js/process_passport.js`'s `{dg1, dg15, sod}` input, then `nargo execute`.
2. **The `icao_root` check's POSITIVE case.** `registerDocumentViaIcao` is proven only by its
   negative test - an unknown root reverts. That a VALID root is accepted has never run.
   *Closes with:* the same document, plus `certificatesSmt` populated by a real
   `registerCertificate`.
3. **The TD1 SOD layout constants** (`EC_LEN 126`, `SA_LEN 62`, `DG1_SHIFT 25`, `EC_SHIFT 42`).
   Inherited from the TD3 profile on the reasoning that they describe SOD structure rather than MRZ
   length. **Plausible, unverified.** *Closes with:* one real TD1 card - and if wrong, it is a
   parameter change, not a redesign.
4. **No Solidity verifier is generated for either full-registration circuit.** Deliberate: a
   verifier that has never accepted a proof is a liability, and `codegen-verifiers.sh`'s self-checks
   need a witness. *Closes with:* item 1.

**TRUST ASSUMPTIONS, NOT PROOFS:**
5. **The CSCA master root is owner-set** (`changeICAOMasterTreeRoot`, `onlyOwner`). Every guarantee
   in sec. 2.18w's table is downstream of someone publishing the right list. *Closes with:* CRE
   consensus anchoring, which removes the discretion rather than documenting it.
6. **Iranian legal claims** - the Land Registration Act making private deeds inadmissible, the
   notary monopoly on consensual mortgages, the foreclosure institutions. From `spec.pdf` plus
   general knowledge, **not from anyone qualified to give an opinion.** *Closes with:* the
   in-country counsel milestone 3 budgets for. Already corrected once (sec. 2.18f), which is
   evidence the rest deserves checking too.

**PARTIALLY PINNED - the whole is tested, the parts are not:**
7. **`CRSASigner`'s individual padding clauses.** Neutering `_checkPkcs1v15` re-admits the forgery,
   so the fix as a whole is load-bearing; removing any SINGLE clause does not, because the forged
   cube is mostly leading zeros and several clauses catch it independently (sec. 2.18u). Each guards
   a different family. *Closes with:* forgeries tailored to bypass all-but-one, which this
   construction cannot produce.
8. **`PRSASHAAuthenticator`'s fix is unit-tested but unreachable in situ** - Active Authentication
   needs DG15 and our variant has `DG15_LEN = 0` (sec. 2.18y). *Closes with:* a DG15-carrying
   profile, if one is ever wired.

**NOT YET BUILT:**
9. **A 93-byte `escrow_envelope`** - required if passport booklets are supported alongside ID cards.
   Second verifier, second fixture pipeline (sec. 2.18ac).
10. **Untested contracts that remain:** the passport dispatchers (`PECDSASHA1Dispatcher`,
    `PRSASHADispatcher`, `PNOAADispatcher`), unreachable for the same reason as item 8, and the
    generated query verifiers. `AQueryProofExecutor`'s root check is covered (sec. 2.18ae) and the
    **signal LAYOUT is now covered too** (sec. 2.18af) - **I had marked that blocked on a real proof
    and it was not**, which is the error this list exists to prevent. What genuinely still needs a
    proof is only end-to-end acceptance: that a real `query_identity` proof verifies against signals
    this builder produced. *Closes with:* item 1.

**THE ONE THING THIS LIST IS FOR:** sec. 2.18w's forgery table reads like an all-clear. It is not,
and items 1, 2 and 5 are why. The guards are real and tested; what has never run is the path they
guard.

### 2.18ae THE PRESENTATION PATH'S ROOT CHECK WAS REAL AND UNTESTED - behind an always-true mock

Followed sec. 2.18ad's own prediction that the query executors were the next place to look.

**I EXPECTED A VACUITY AND DID NOT FIND ONE.** `AQueryProofExecutor.execute*` take
`registrationRoot_` FROM THE CALLER and feed it into the public signals - textbook sec. 2.18k shape.
The executor itself contains no validation, and `_beforeVerify` is an EMPTY VIRTUAL HOOK, which
reads exactly like a security check left optional. **The check exists**, in
`PublicSignalsBuilder.withIdStateRoot`: `isRootValid`, reverting `InvalidRegistrationRoot`. Not in
the file anyone would look in first, which is worth knowing on its own.

**BUT NOTHING EXERCISED IT, AND THE REASON IS THE INTERESTING PART.** The only harness on this path,
`mock/sdk/ProofBuilderTest.sol`, wires a `MockRegistrationSMT` whose `isRootValid` **returns TRUE
UNCONDITIONALLY**. So the guard was inert in every existing test and **would have stayed green if
someone deleted it** - the precise defect already caught once in this project with
`MockEntrypoint.isValidRoot`, sitting in a second place.

**NOW COVERED WITH A REAL `PoseidonSMT`:** an invented root, an invented root on the TD1 entry point,
and the zero root are each refused; and a root the tree genuinely holds gets PAST the check and on to
proof verification, which is what proves the guard rejects the root specifically rather than failing
everything. Verified by removal: deleting the check makes two of the four fail.

**IT IS ALSO A FOURTH CONSUMER OF `isRootValid`** (after the identity registry, the escrow path and
`Registration2`'s certificate gate). Until sec. 2.18o that function accepted ANY root on a chain
younger than an hour - so this check was vacuous on a fresh chain or L2 **even with a real SMT
behind it**. Four independent guards, one shared failure, which is the sec. 2.18q argument again.

### 2.18af THE SIGNAL LAYOUT WAS TESTABLE ALL ALONG - I had it filed as blocked

*(user: "if anything can be done now before we have phone or passport, do it, do not wait")* sec.
2.18ad listed the signal building as blocked on a real proof. **That was wrong.** The builder is a
pure function from inputs to 23 words; checking that each lands in the slot the circuit reads it
from needs no proof, no phone and no document. Filed as blocked, done in twenty minutes.

**WHY IT MATTERS.** `PublicSignalsBuilder` assembles the signals a `query_identity` proof is
verified against, and **their order is a contract with the circuit that nothing enforced.** A field
one slot out verifies happily against the wrong claim - a proof of nationality checked as though it
were sex, an age bound applied to an expiry date. Silent, and wrong in the direction that matters.

**THE EXISTING TESTS COULD NOT HAVE CAUGHT IT.** `mock/sdk/ProofBuilderTest.sol`'s eleven
"equivalence" tests compare the library against a reference **in the same file**. That proves
internal consistency and says nothing about the circuit - the same vacuity as sec. 2.18i, where both
sides of my cross-path test called one function.

**THE REFERENCE USED HERE IS THE CIRCUIT SOURCE**, the only thing that cannot drift with the
library. Mapped by hand from `query_identity/src/main.nr`'s return tuple against the builder's
`mstore` offsets (`slot = (offset - 32) / 32`), and **every one matches**: nullifier at 0, the
identity fields at 3-7, eventId/eventData at 9-10, idStateRoot 11, selector 12, and the five bound
PAIRS through 22.

**THE BOUND PAIRS ARE THE DANGEROUS PART** and get their own test: every one is a (lower, upper) of
the same shape, so a pair written one slot out still looks like a plausible range while constraining
the WRONG attribute. Verified by swapping two adjacent bound slots - the test fails immediately.

Also pinned: the array is exactly 23 long, and unset date slots default to `ZERO_DATE` rather than 0,
since the circuit reads them as passport timestamps and a raw zero is a different claim from
"unconstrained".

### 2.18ag THE PASSPORT DISPATCHERS - and a vacuous test I wrote while documenting vacuous tests

Last untested cluster. Unreachable today (AA needs DG15, our variant is `DG15_LEN = 0`) and tested
anyway, on sec. 2.18y's reasoning: unreachable is a property of one generic in one circuit, not of
the code.

**FOUND AND BOUNDED.** `PECDSASHA1Dispatcher.authenticate` reads `r`, `s`, `x`, `y` by raw `mload`
at fixed offsets into caller-supplied arrays **without consulting their lengths** - so a short
signature or key pulls adjacent memory into the verification inputs. Same shape as sec. 2.18m.

**AND THE TEST I WROTE FOR IT IS VACUOUS.** Removing the guard does NOT make it fail: whatever the
out-of-bounds read picks up still has to satisfy ECDSA verification, garbage does not, so
`authenticate` returns false either way. **It passes with the guard and without it.** I wrote it,
ran the removal check out of habit, and it came back green - which is the only reason I know.

That is worth more than the fix. **A test asserting the CORRECT outcome for the WRONG reason is
indistinguishable from a working one until you delete the code it claims to guard.** Every removal
check this session has been cheap; this is the first where the answer was "your test proves
nothing", and it would have read as coverage forever.

Left in place with the limitation written into the file rather than quietly deleted, because the
tests still pin something real - that refusal is explicit and does not depend on surrounding memory.
What would genuinely prove the guard is adjacent bytes forming a VERIFYING tuple, which needs
control of Solidity's memory layout I do not have here. **So the guard is defence in depth, not a
fix for a demonstrated exploit, and it is labelled that way.**

**ALSO COVERED, and these are not vacuous:** the ECDSA dispatcher unpacks a real brainpoolP256r1
response to the same verdict as the authenticator; the challenge is the last 8 bytes of the identity
key big-endian, and both dispatchers agree on that convention - a mismatch would let a response be
replayed under a different identity; and `PNOAADispatcher` accepts ONLY an empty signature, which is
its entire security, since returning true regardless would let a document that supports AA skip it
by claiming not to.

### 2.18ah THE WITHDRAWAL CIRCUIT HAD ZERO TESTS - the one that spends money

Surveyed circuit coverage looking for work with no external requirement. `pp` has 84 tests and
`noir_dl_lib` 63, but **`withdraw_identity` had NONE**, and neither did `title_holder`,
`query_identity` or `register_identity_light_td1`.

**THE PIECES WERE TESTED; THE COMPOSITION WAS NOT.** `commitment_hasher`, `lean_imt_inclusion`,
`smt_verifier_full` and `secret_commitment` all have their own vectors in `pp`. What nothing
exercised was `main` - and a wiring error there (two `Field` arguments swapped, a check reading the
wrong variable) is invisible to every unit test in `pp` and still produces a circuit that proves and
verifies perfectly.

**NO EXTERNAL DATA WAS EVER NEEDED, which is the uncomfortable part.** A single-leaf LeanIMT has
root == leaf by its carry-up rule, and a single-leaf SMT root is `Poseidon(key, value, 1)` - so a
complete valid witness is constructible in-circuit with no fixture, phone or document. **The absence
of tests was a choice, not a constraint**, and it sat behind the most security-critical circuit in
the repo for the whole project.

**FIVE TESTS:** a consistent withdrawal proves; a WRONG revocation secret cannot withdraw (the
identity gate - the registry key is derived from the secret precisely so a prover cannot name a
clean identity, all of which are public in the tree); withdrawing more than the note holds fails
(the 128-bit range check exists so the subtraction cannot wrap the field and mint a balance); a
false nullifier hash cannot prove (single-spend); and withdrawing the ENTIRE note is ALLOWED, which
is asserted because a range check written slightly wrong would reject exactly that case and leave a
user unable to empty a note.

**THE NEGATIVES ARE VERIFIED, NOT ASSUMED.** `#[test(should_fail)]` passes if the test fails for ANY
reason - the same trap as a bare `expectRevert()`, and I have already written one vacuous test today
(sec. 2.18ag). So each negative was checked by REMOVING the guard it targets: deleting the identity
assert makes the wrong-secret test stop failing, deleting the nullifier assert makes the false-hash
test stop failing. Each targets its own guard.

**AND THE COMPILER FOUND SOMETHING** - which turned out to be a naming problem, not a dead input.
*"we cant have unused things. what couldve been the use of it"* (user, 2026-07-29). Fair question, and
the answer is that `context` is the single most load-bearing signal in the circuit's public I/O.

**WHAT IT IS FOR.** `context` carries `keccak256(abi.encode(withdrawal, SCOPE)) % SNARK_SCALAR_FIELD`
- the recipient, the fee, the processooor, the pool. **Nothing else in this circuit names who gets
paid.** `new_commitment`, `withdrawn_value`, the roots, the nullifier hash - a proof of all of those
is equally a valid proof for ANY recipient. So without `context` a withdrawal proof sitting in the
mempool could be copied by anyone, re-submitted with themselves as `processooor`, and the money would
follow. `context` is what makes a proof about one withdrawal instead of about an amount.

**WHY NOTHING CONSTRAINS IT, AND WHY THAT IS RIGHT.** There is nothing to check in-circuit. The
value's meaning lives entirely in data only the contract holds - the `Withdrawal` struct and `SCOPE`
are not circuit inputs and could not be without hashing keccak inside a Poseidon circuit for no gain.
What the circuit owes is not a computation but a COMMITMENT: that the proof is bound to whatever
value was passed. `pub` delivers exactly that, in the transcript, gate or no gate. Then
`PrivacyPool.validWithdrawal` recomputes the hash from the real withdrawal data and reverts
`ContextMismatch` on disagreement. The division of labour is deliberate: the circuit binds, the
contract interprets.

**PROVEN, NOT ARGUED.** sec. 2.3 inferred the binding from `publicInputsSize == 8`, which is evidence
about the verification key rather than about behaviour. `WithdrawalHonkVerifier.t.sol` now tampers
this signal on TWO real proofs - `test_RejectsTamperedContext`, `test_RejectsTamperedWalletContext` -
and both are rejected by the verifier itself, before any contract-level comparison. Had Noir optimised
an ungated public input away, those tests would pass tampering through and fail.

**DOES `let _ =` MAKE THE VALUE UNUSABLE? NO - PROBED, NOT ASSUMED.** *"the underscore still troubles
me, that makes the context unusable?"* (user, 2026-07-29). A fair worry, and reasoning by analogy to
Rust would have been a guess about a different compiler. A two-input scratch circuit settles it:

```noir
fn main(a: pub Field, b: pub Field) {
    let _ = a;
    assert(a + b == 12, "a was not usable after let _ = a");
}
```

It compiles (so `a` is still usable after being discarded) and the `should_fail` case `main(5, 8)`
fails as required (so the constraint is LIVE, not elided). `_` evaluates and drops; it does not move,
shadow, consume or mark. `context` remains an ordinary parameter and an ordinary public input, and if
a constraint on it is ever wanted the `let _` line simply becomes redundant. Corroborated twice over:
opcode count is 24,812 with and without it, and both real proofs still verify - neither of which a
line that changed `context`'s status could manage.

**WHAT CHANGED.** `let _ = context;` in the body, plus the reasoning at the parameter. No constraints
(24,812 opcodes before and after; both real proofs still verify, so the ACIR is byte-identical). The
point is the warning: `unused variable context` fired on every build, and a warning that is expected
forever is a warning nobody reads - so the day a public input goes unused BY ACCIDENT, the diagnostic
that would have caught it is already background noise. Silencing it deliberately keeps the channel
clean.

**THE RESIDUAL RISK WAS THE CONTRACT'S, AND IT IS NOW CLOSED BY CONSTRUCTION.** *"we cant have silent
vanishings like that. how can we make this safer"* (user, 2026-07-29). Correct instinct, and recording
the hazard was the weaker answer. The binding rested on three lines in `validWithdrawal`:

```solidity
if (_proof.context() != keccak256(abi.encode(_withdrawal, SCOPE)) % SNARK_SCALAR_FIELD) revert ContextMismatch();
```

Delete them and the happy path still works, the code that remains still looks complete, and the tie
between a proof and its recipient is gone. **The defect was the SHAPE, not the arithmetic** - a
comparison is deletable, and nothing downstream depends on it having run.

**THE FIX: MAKE IT AN ARGUMENT, NOT A CHECK.** `ProofLib.publicInputsBytes32` now takes the context
from its CALLER and writes it into slot [6], ignoring `pubSignals[6]` entirely. `PrivacyPool.withdraw`
passes `_contextFor(_withdrawal)`. The verifier cannot be called without a context, so there is no
longer a line whose deletion silently weakens anything - delete the derivation and it does not
compile. The unsafe no-argument overload was REMOVED rather than kept alongside, because a safe
variant beside an unsafe one only relocates the mistake.

The admission set is unchanged: a proof made for this withdrawal has `pubSignals[6] == context_` and
verifies exactly as before. `ContextMismatch` survives as a DIAGNOSTIC - a relayer handed a stale
proof learns what is wrong, rather than getting a bare `InvalidProof` - and is documented as carrying
no security.

**VERIFIED BY MUTATION, which is the only way to test a claim about deletion.** With the modifier
check commented out, `test_ProofIsBoundToItsWithdrawalParameters` (a genuine proof replayed against
`address(0xBAD)`) still fails - and `-vvvv` names the cause as **`SumcheckFailed()`**, the Honk
verifier itself rejecting the proof. Before this change that same mutation would have let the replay
through. Restored afterwards; 372 forge tests pass, client ABIs clean.

**AND THE TEST GAP THAT ALLOWED IT.** Every existing test fed the verifier the PROVER'S OWN context,
so all of them agreed with themselves and none could see the substitution missing.
`test_RejectsAContextTheContractDerivedDifferently` closes that: an untouched, genuine proof verified
against a context it was not made for must fail, and against the right one must pass.

### 2.18ai "BUT WE GOT RID OF GROTH COMPLETELY?" - yes, in the pool. The comments hadn't noticed.

The question came from a comment I had just read aloud: `ragequit` calls a Noir verifier under a line
saying *"Verify proof with Groth16 verifier"*. Checked rather than assumed - `State.sol` declares
**both** verifiers as `INoirVerifier`, and `ragequit` takes `bytes proof` with no `pA`/`pB`/`pC`. So
the pool is 100% Honk and a dozen comments still said otherwise.

**Worse than merely stale - actively contradictory.** `PrivacyPoolSimple.t.sol` claimed ragequit
"stays Groth16, matching State.sol's two distinct verifier types" while declaring `NoirVerifierMock`
for BOTH verifiers two lines below. `ProofLib.RagequitProof` carried `@param pA`, `@param pB`,
`@param pC` for fields the struct does not have. A reader trusting either would form a false model of
the trust boundary - which is exactly how the `icaoMasterTreeMerkleRoot` mis-naming nearly cost a day
(sec. 2.18k).

**Fixed at nine sites**, all comments/docs, no logic: `PrivacyPool.sol` (constructor params, the
ragequit line, a "Groth16/Noir" hedge), `IState.sol`, `IPrivacyPool.InvalidProof`, `ProofLib` (title
plus the three phantom `@param`s), `NoirVerifierMock`, `PrivacyPoolSimple.t.sol`, `PP-NOIR-FUSION.md`.
Where the old claim was once true, the note now says so and dates it, rather than silently reversing.

**AND ONE DEAD FILE.** `contracts/pool/interfaces/IVerifier.sol` - the Groth16
`verifyProof(pA,pB,pC,uint[8])` interface - had no importers left. The `IVerifier` matches elsewhere
are interfaces the generated Honk verifiers declare INTERNALLY at their own line 129, not this file.
Deleted and verified the way sec. 2.18 established: build, then the full suite. 372 tests pass, so it
was genuinely dead rather than dead-looking.

**WHAT IS STILL GROTH16, AND LEGITIMATELY SO.** The rarime registration side -
`RegistrationSimple.sol`, `Registration2.sol`, `AQueryProofExecutor.sol` - imports solarity's
`Groth16VerifierHelper` and verifies real Circom proofs. `AQueryProofExecutor` is deliberately
dual-stack (`execute` for Circom, `executeNoir` for Honk). "We got rid of Groth16" is true of the
POOL and false of the identity stack, and the two are easy to conflate because both live here.

### 2.18aj GOING FULLY HONK COSTS SIX PASSPORTS - the exact number, and what it buys

*"how many different passports would we need to eventually be fully honk and what would that give
us"* (user, 2026-07-29). Countable, so counted.

**I FIRST ANSWERED THIS WRONG.** I said our Noir coverage was "three circuits" against 35 Circom
profiles, and concluded convergence would need a re-validation programme against real documents from
every issuer. That compared our OWN `backend/circuits/` against rarime's vendored verifiers. The repo
also vendors **76 `NoirRegisterIdentity_*` verifiers** under `passport/verifiers2/noir/` - MORE
profiles than the Circom set, including signature types (6, 7, 8, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28) and SHA-384
that Circom never had. rarime already did most of this migration. Counting beat reasoning, and the
reasoning had been confident.

**THE ACTUAL GAP: 6 PROFILES.** 29 of the 35 Circom profiles already have a Noir twin. The orphans:

| profile | signature (decoded from the lib's own SIG_TYPE dispatch) | hash | Active Auth? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `1_160_3_4_576_200_NA` | RSA-2048, e=65537 | SHA-1 | no |
| `20_160_3_3_736_200_NA` | ECDSA secp256r1 | SHA-1 | no |

**THE CRYPTOGRAPHY IS NOT THE BLOCKER, and an earlier version of this section said it was.** I wrote
"signature type 4 is unported entirely", reading that off the VERIFIER FILENAMES rather than the
library. `not_passports_zk_circuits.nr` dispatches SIG_TYPE 1-8, 10-15, 20-21 and 23-27 - every type
these six need is already implemented. Third time the same mistake in this session (sec. 2.18h,
sec. 2.18aj's first count, sec. 2.18ak): a number read off the nearest file instead of the thing it
claims to measure.

**WHAT IS ACTUALLY MISSING is the per-profile SOD LAYOUT: `EC_LEN`, `SA_LEN`, `N`.** The profile name
encodes only SIG_TYPE, hash bits, doc type, `EC_SHIFT` (name value / 8) and `DG1_SHIFT` (name value /
8) - verified against our own circuit, where `336/8 = 42 = EC_SHIFT` and `200/8 = 25 = DG1_SHIFT`. It
does NOT encode the three that decide WHICH BYTES GET HASHED, no profile->parameter table exists
anywhere in this repo, and these six by definition have no rarime Noir source to copy from. Inventing
them is refused under sec. 2.18k: a wrong `SA_LEN` compiles cleanly and hashes the wrong span, with no
symptom until a real document disagrees.

**THREE OF THE SIX CARRY ACTIVE AUTHENTICATION - they ARE the DG15 profiles.** DG15 is the ICAO 9303
data group holding the chip's AA public key; AA is the challenge-response that proves the chip is
genuine rather than a clone of its data. Our circuits set `DG15_LEN = 0`, which is what the trailing
`NA` means in a profile name, and it is why `PRSASHAAuthenticator` and the passport dispatchers are
unreachable in situ. **So porting these six would also close sec. 2.18ad items 8 and 10 as a side
effect** - a better argument for the migration than the toolchain tidiness first offered here.

**GENERATING the circuits needs ZERO passports** - five of the six differ from an existing Noir
profile only in SOD layout offsets, which is a parameter change exactly like `register_identity_td1`
(sec. 2.18ac), not new design. Only signature type 4 is genuinely unported. **VALIDATING them is what
needs documents: one per profile, so SIX.** Three are SHA-1, i.e. legacy documents being phased out -
drop those and it is **three**. Accept 29/35 (83%) coverage and it is **zero**.

**WHAT IT BUYS, honestly ranked:**

1. **NO PER-CIRCUIT TRUSTED SETUP.** This is the only argument that matters. Groth16 needs a ceremony
   PER CIRCUIT - 35 of them, whose artifacts we did not produce, cannot audit, and would be trusting
   rarime for. A compromised ceremony forges identities SILENTLY: fake registrations verify perfectly.
   Honk needs only a universal SRS. For users whose alternative to this system is a sanctioned bank,
   an unauditable ceremony is the wrong thing to ask them to trust.
2. **One toolchain.** nargo/bb only - no circom/snarkjs in CI or the client bundle.
3. **Deletes the dual entrypoints** - `register`, `reissueIdentity`, `_verifyCircomZKProof`,
   `Groth16VerifierHelper`, and `AQueryProofExecutor.execute`. The ambiguity IS those pairs.
4. **One audit surface** instead of two proving systems.

**WHAT IT DOES NOT BUY: size.** The Circom verifiers are **420K**; the Noir set we are KEEPING is
**11M**. Going fully Honk makes the repo bigger, not smaller. (An earlier note implying "13 MB of
Groth16" conflated the two directories - the 13M is the whole `verifiers2` tree.)

**THE POOL IS ALREADY DONE** (sec. 2.18ai), which is the source of the confusion: "are we on one
stack?" is YES for the pool and NOT YET for identity. Ambiguity killed at the two places the split is
visible - `Registration2.registerViaNoir` and `AQueryProofExecutor` now state which stack owns which
entrypoint, that `registerCertificate` is signature-gated and belongs to NEITHER, and that new
capability goes to the Noir side.

**THE ORDERED PLAN - steps 1-4 need no document, 5 does, and 6 MUST NOT PRECEDE 5.** *"is this first
step to getting away from groth16?"* (user, 2026-07-30). Yes, first of six:

1. **✅ STEP 1 DONE 2026-08-03 - AND THE PREMISE IS FALSE, so the plan collapses to "needs
   documents" exactly as this step was written to catch.** `RegisterIdentityBuilder` takes TEN
   parameters and they are precisely the ten the profile NAME encodes: `SIGNATURE_TYPE,
   DG_HASH_TYPE, DOCUMENT_TYPE, EC_BLOCK_NUMBER, EC_SHIFT, DG1_SHIFT, AA_SIGNATURE_ALGO,
   DG15_SHIFT, DG15_BLOCK_NUMBER, AA_SHIFT`. **There is no `EC_LEN` and no `SA_LEN` anywhere in it** -
   `signedAttributes` is sized by a HARDCODED `var SIGNED_ATTRIBUTES_LEN = 1024`, `encapsulatedContent`
   by `EC_BLOCK_NUMBER * HASH_BLOCK_SIZE`, and `CHUNK_NUMBER` (the key limb count) is derived from
   `SIGNATURE_TYPE` by an internal switch.
   **WHY CIRCOM DOESN'T NEED THEM AND NOIR DOES:** circom is handed content ALREADY PADDED, and SHA
   padding encodes the true length in the DATA. Our Noir port takes `ec: [u8; EC_LEN]` raw and pads
   in-circuit, so it needs a number circom never had to know. Padding our arrays instead would make
   the circuit pad twice and hash the wrong span.
   **ALSO CHECKED:** none of the six orphans has a published rarimo NOIR artifact (82 published
   profiles enumerated from their releases), so the file_map recovery that produced
   `passport-profiles.json` for the other 75 cannot reach these. **Steps 2-4 are NOT mechanical and
   must not be started; the six need one document each, like task 6.**
   (Original wording kept for context: it needed a fetch of rarime's public Circom repo.) That their Circom
   circuits instantiate each profile with explicit `EC_LEN`/`SA_LEN` is **an INFERENCE, not a checked
   fact.** The circuits must carry concrete lengths somewhere, but that repo's layout has not been
   looked at. If the premise is false the plan collapses back to "needs documents", so verify before
   building anything. Flagged this loudly because three claims in this session (sec. 2.18h, this
   section's own first count, sec. 2.18ak) were read off the nearest artifact instead of the thing
   they measured.
2. **PORT** the six parameter tuples into six Noir wrapper crates, as `register_identity_td1` was
   built (sec. 2.18ac). Mechanical.
3. **IN-CIRCUIT CONSISTENCY TESTS** per profile, mirroring the TD1 cross-checks that `dg1_hash` and
   `dgCommit` agree with the light path at the same length. Catches transcription errors.
4. **`bb` CODEGEN** for six Honk verifiers. Mechanical.
5. **BLOCKED - VALIDATE each against one real document.** Steps 2-4 prove the circuits are
   SELF-CONSISTENT, not that they read a real SOD correctly. A wrong `SA_LEN` passes every test in
   step 3 and still hashes the wrong byte span - the same shape as the selector mask in sec. 2.18al:
   consistent with itself, wrong about the world.
6. **ONLY THEN DELETE:** `register`, `reissueIdentity`, `_verifyCircomZKProof`, the
   `Groth16VerifierHelper` import, `InvalidCircomProof`, `AQueryProofExecutor.execute`, the 35
   per-passport verifier contracts, and the wallet's `zkPoints` plumbing (`IdentityVault.ts`,
   `RegistrationSimple.json`).

**WHY STEP 6 CANNOT JUMP THE QUEUE.** Deleting a path rarime validated against real passports, in
favour of our unvalidated port, is a REGRESSION rather than a migration. sec. 2.18ad item 4 already
states the principle: a verifier that has never accepted a proof is a liability. Porting moves the
blocker from "we do not know the numbers" to "we have not validated them" - real progress, and still
not permission to delete.

### 2.18ak TEST COVERAGE, COUNTED PROPERLY - and why the first count was wrong

*"the table you gave me... it's already the contents of TODO.md?"* (user, 2026-07-29). It was not.
sec. 2.18ad's items 1-10 came from this file; every COVERAGE row was assembled live from a filesystem
inventory and written nowhere. Unrecorded work gets re-derived, so here it is.

**THE FIRST COUNT WAS WRONG, and wrong in the direction that wastes effort.** I reported
`title_holder`, `query_identity`, `query_identity_td1` and `register_identity_light_td1` as
"zero-coverage circuits". All four are THIN WRAPPER CRATES - `main.nr` files of 13-49 lines that
forward to a library gadget. Counting `#[test]` in the wrapper says nothing about the gadget:

- `title_holder` -> `pp::title_holder::title_holder_proof`. Tested in `pp`, and **already proved
  on-chain** against the generated verifier (`TitleHolderHonkVerifier.t.sol`, sec. 2.3).
- `register_identity_light_td1` -> `noir_dl::lite::register_identity_light`. Covered by `lite.nr`'s
  known-answer vector plus the TD1 cross-checks in `register_identity_td1` (sec. 2.18ac).
- `query_identity` / `query_identity_td1` -> `noir_dl::query`. **This one is genuinely uncovered.**

Counting the wrong artifact is the same failure as sec. 2.18h ("dispatchers are not needed at all")
and sec. 2.18aj (comparing our `backend/circuits/` against rarime's vendored verifiers): a number
read off the nearest file rather than the thing it claims to measure.

**WHERE COVERAGE ACTUALLY STANDS** (measured 2026-07-29):

| unit | tests | note |
|---|---|---|
| `pp` (all gadgets) | 84 | commitment, lean_imt, smt, envelope, jubjub, title_holder |
| `noir_dl::smt` | 11 | |
| `noir_dl::rsa` / `rsa_pss` | 5 / 5 | |
| `noir_dl::jubjub` | 5 | |
| `noir_dl::sha1/224/384/512` | 2 each | |
| `noir_dl::lite` | 1 | the dg1_hash known-answer vector |
| `withdraw_identity` | 5 | first ever, sec. 2.18ah |
| `escrow_envelope` | 4 | |
| `ragequit` | 3 | |
| **`noir_dl::query`** | **0** | **883 lines. THE REAL GAP.** |
| **`noir_dl::not_passports_zk_circuits`** | **0** | 907 lines, but see below |
| **wallet TypeScript** | **0 test files** | `check-recovery.js` is a script, not a suite |

**`query.nr` IS THE ONE TO DO, and it needs no document.** It decides WHAT A PROOF REVEALS -
selector bits, birth-date and expiry lower/upper bounds, citizenship mask, identity counters. It is
arithmetic over a DG1 byte array that can be constructed in-circuit, exactly like sec. 2.18ah's
witness. An off-by-one in a date bound or a mis-masked selector discloses more than the user chose,
and nothing would fail loudly.

**`not_passports_zk_circuits.nr` IS NOT** - its core is `passport_verification_flow`, which needs a
real SOD (sec. 2.18ad item 1). The parts that DON'T (`extract_dg1_commitment`) are already exercised
by `register_identity_td1`'s two tests.

**YES, THE UNTESTED SCOPE IS INHERITED - AND THAT IS PROVABLE, NOT AN EXCUSE.** *"are you telling me
that rarimo upstream had untested scope that we inherited?"* (user, 2026-07-29). Checked at the fork
commit `0762975`, which is the only honest way to answer it:

| module | tests AT FORK | tests NOW | who |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rsa.nr` | 5 | 5 | rarime |
| `rsa_pss.nr` | 5 | 5 | rarime |
| `sha1/224/384.nr` | 2 each | 2 each | rarime |
| `jubjub.nr` | 3 | 5 | rarime + 2 ours |
| `smt.nr` | 1 | 11 | rarime + 10 ours |
| `sha512.nr` | 0 | 2 | ours |
| `lite.nr` | 0 | 1 | ours |
| **`query.nr`** | **0** | **0** | **inherited, still open** |
| **`not_passports_zk_circuits.nr`** | **0** | **0** | **inherited, needs a document** |

**THE VENDORING DID NOT STRIP TESTS** - `rsa.nr` arrived carrying five. So `query.nr`'s zero is
upstream's actual state, not an artifact of how the fork was taken. The same holds for the vendored
crypto: `sigver` has 25 tests across 31 files, but `big_curve` has **1 across 17**.

That is an explanation of PROVENANCE, not a defence. Inheriting an untested 883-line file that decides
what a proof discloses makes it ours the moment we shipped it.

**AND THE REASON REAL-PASSPORT TESTING DOES NOT COVER IT - the sentence to remember:**

> **A selector mask can be wrong for every passport ever tried and still verify.**

rarime tested with real passports; that is their empirical claim and it is credible. It establishes
something different from what is needed here. A passport test exercises the SIGNATURE path: does this
chip's SOD verify, does the DSC chain to a CSCA. It says nothing about the DISCLOSURE arithmetic,
because a proof that reveals too much still verifies perfectly. Every party in the loop is satisfied:
the prover produced a valid proof, the verifier accepted it, the passport was genuine. The only thing
wrong is WHICH FIELDS CAME OUT, and no cryptographic check anywhere is looking at that. The same holds
for a birth-date bound off by one day, an expiry comparison using the wrong operator, or a citizenship
mask that ORs where it should AND.

This generalises past `query.nr`, and it is the reason this project keeps finding defects in things
that "work": **a check that cannot fail loudly is not covered by testing the happy path.** It is the
same shape as sec. 2.18ah's deletable context comparison, sec. 2.18 ae's always-true mock, and the
sec. 2.18o root-validity guard that silently passed for every invented root.

**WHAT ELSE IS UNTESTED REPO-WIDE, since the rule is "no untested thing":**

| unit | lines | tests | ours or inherited? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `noir_dl/src/query.nr` | 883 | 0 | inherited |
| `noir_dl/src/not_passports_zk_circuits.nr` | 907 | 0 | inherited, needs a document |
| `noir_dl/src/big_curve` | 17 files | 1 | inherited |
| **`backend/cre/notary_registry/main.go`** | **~500** | **0** | **OURS** |
| wallet TypeScript (`pp/`, `identity/`, `sdk/`) | - | 0 test files | ours |

**`main.go` IS THE UNCOMFORTABLE ONE** - it is our own code, not vendored, and it is the CRE workflow
that scrapes Ukraine's Ministry of Justice notary registry (sec. 2.15a). Its parsing logic is exactly
what sec. 2.15a warns about ("scrapers rot"), it is plain Go testable against fixture HTML with no
document and no network, and it has no tests at all. Nothing about it is blocked.

**CRE IS NOT A PREREQUISITE FOR ANY OF IT.** sec. 2.15a's scraper anchors the ACTIVE-NOTARY snapshot;
it feeds `TitleLedger`'s notary side, not the passport query path. And even for `title_holder`, the
circuit proves set membership against a root - where the root comes from is orthogonal to whether the
circuit is wired correctly.

### 2.18al QUERY.NR HAD ZERO TESTS - the file that decides what a proof reveals

**WRITTEN LATE, AND THAT IS THE POINT.** This section did not exist until 2026-07-31: the work landed
in commit `aaf9b79` and the reasoning went into the COMMIT MESSAGE ONLY, while two other sections
(2.18ak, 2.18an) cited `sec. 2.18al` as though it were here. A pointer to nothing is worse than no
pointer, because it reads as though the context was captured. Found by auditing every `sec. 2.x`
citation against the headings that actually exist - see the end of 2.18as.

**THE FILE.** `noir_dl_lib/src/query.nr`, 883 lines, inherited from rarime at the fork commit with
zero tests - verified rather than assumed: `rsa.nr` arrived carrying five, so vendoring did not strip
them (2.18ak). It decides WHAT A PROOF DISCLOSES: selector bits, birth-date and expiry bounds,
citizenship mask, identity counters.

**WHY REAL-PASSPORT TESTING DOES NOT COVER IT** - the sentence this project keeps coming back to:

> **A selector mask can be wrong for every passport ever tried and still verify.**

A passport test exercises the SIGNATURE path: does this SOD verify, does the DSC chain to a CSCA. A
proof that reveals the wrong fields still verifies perfectly - prover satisfied, verifier satisfied,
passport genuine. Nothing cryptographic anywhere looks at which values came out.

**12 TESTS, and what each pins:**
- **The selector map, bit by bit.** The code indexes `selector.to_be_bits::<18>()` - big-endian, so
  documented bit k lived at index 17-k. Pick the wrong end and every field is still multiplied by
  SOME bit: the proof verifies and the caller gets a different field than it asked for. Verified
  non-vacuous by MUTATION - swapping the birth-date and expiration-date bits fails 3 tests.
- **An empty selector discloses nothing** - the fail-safe direction, caught on the first run if the
  masking is ever inverted.
- **The nullifier is 0 for EVERYONE when its bit is clear.** A relying party doing double-spend
  prevention on that value without checking the bit would treat all holders as one person. A caller
  obligation the circuit cannot enforce, so it is written down.
- **The bounds are OPT-IN, both directions.** `assert(n1 OR NOT n2)` enforces a bound only when its
  bit is set, so a verifier who wants "born before 1995" and forgets the bit gets a valid proof
  saying NOTHING about age, with no error. Both the skip and the bite are tested - a bound that
  rejects everything is not a working bound.
- **`date_is_less` boundaries**: the two-digit-year pivot at equality, strict-less (an equal date is
  not less), and month outranking day. An off-by-one there shifts every age comparison by a century
  for one birth year, and the proof still verifies.

**A DEFECT THE TESTS FOUND ON THE FIRST RUN: zero is not a no-op date bound.** The obvious way to say
"I do not care about birth date" is to pass 0. It does not skip the check, it ABORTS PROVING -
`date_is_less` does `to_be_bytes::<6>()` then `date[0] - 48`, so a zero byte underflows a u8. Worse,
`date_is_less` runs UNCONDITIONALLY, before the gate that decides whether anyone cares, so a caller
who correctly leaves the bit clear still cannot produce a proof. And it is loud only by ACCIDENT:
Noir's u8 underflow check is the only thing making it visible - the same arithmetic over a `Field`
would wrap to an enormous year and silently invert the comparison. Pinned rather than clamped, since
clamping trades a loud abort for a quietly wrong comparison. The real gap is that no "unused"
sentinel exists: "000000" parses as year 2000, month 0, day 0.

**THE TD1 HALF came later and found the bigger defect** - one selector bit gating two unrelated
things, leaking a national ID. See 2.18an.

### 2.18am THE NOTARY IS NAMED ON-CHAIN - the application claimed the opposite

*"openable by a quorum of custodians against a proven fault"?* (user, 2026-07-31). Quoted from
FUNDING-APPLICATION.md, and the question mark was right. **Three claims in one sentence, all false.**

The sentence read: *"which notary acted is never published: they prove membership of the licensed set
without naming a member, their identity travelling encrypted, openable by a quorum of custodians
against a proven fault."* What the code does:

| claim | reality |
|---|---|
| "never published" | `TitleEntry.notary` is an `address` inside `mapping(uint256 => TitleEntry) public titles` - directly readable. Worse, THREE events emit `address indexed notary` (`TitleMinted`, `LegendAdded`, `EncumbranceSet`). **`indexed` makes it a searchable topic**, so "every title this notary touched" is one log query. Not merely published - INDEXED FOR LOOKUP. |
| "membership without naming a member" | `_requireActiveNotary(registryId_, notary_, proof_)` takes the notary's ADDRESS plus a Merkle proof. It is inclusion for a NAMED member, not anonymous set membership. |
| "identity travelling encrypted, openable by a quorum" | **No threshold or quorum cryptography exists anywhere in this repo.** The only sealing is `pp::envelope`, used at exactly one call site - `escrow_envelope/src/main.nr:215` - to seal the BORROWER's revocation secret. And it is not a quorum: `open_payload(envelope, controller_secret)` takes ONE key. |

**AND A FOURTH EXPOSURE THE SENTENCE DID NOT EVEN CLAIM TO SOLVE.** `notaryDataHashOf` is a PUBLIC
mapping from `holderRoot` to `keccak(regNumber, fullName, region, status)`. Every preimage component
comes from the official register - which is public by construction, since sec. 2.15a's whole design is
a decentralised oracle network SCRAPING it. So the hash is enumerable: compute it for every notary in
the register and match. `TitleLedger`'s own comment concedes the input, noting `holderRoot` "is
already public in the registration events".

**WHY THIS ONE MATTERED MORE THAN THE OTHER CORRECTIONS.** It is a SAFETY claim about people the same
paragraph says "can be punished for serving a system like this", in a document asking for money. The
other errors this session cost effort; this one could cost somebody their liberty if anyone relied on
it. Fixed immediately rather than noted - the application now says the notary is named on-chain today
and that anonymising them is designed, not built (997/1000 words, down 2).

**WHAT BUILDING IT WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE** - recorded so the sentence is never restored without them:
1. Anonymous set membership: prove "I am in the active-notary snapshot" WITHOUT passing an address.
   `title_holder` already proves a commitment against a root, so the shape exists; the notary path
   simply does not use it.
2. Drop `address indexed notary` from all three events and the public `titles` mapping - the
   membership proof is worthless while an indexed topic names them anyway.
3. `notaryDataHashOf` must stop being a public enumerable map of register-derived preimages.
4. A CUSTODIAN SET AND A THRESHOLD SCHEME THAT DO NOT EXIST - who holds shares, what "proven fault"
   means procedurally, and what stops the quorum colluding. This is the largest piece and it is a
   governance design, not a circuit.

**ITEM 4 DISSOLVED - THERE IS NO GOVERNANCE TO DESIGN.** *"there is no governance design. we are
inheriting the ASP structure of PP, why should it be any extension of that"* (user, 2026-07-31). That
removes the hardest part of the problem, and it does so by correcting the PRIMITIVE rather than by
descoping: **the ASP answer to a proven fault is REVOCATION, not deanonymisation.** Privacy Pools
never opens a bad actor's identity - it EXCLUDES them from the association set. Our identity registry
already works exactly that way: `withdraw_identity` proves inclusion at STATUS_CLEAN, and revoking
writes a non-zero value no clean-status proof can equal. A revoked notary simply stops being able to
prove anything, and nobody learns who they were. "Openable by a quorum" was answering a question the
architecture does not ask.

**BUILT AND PROVEN (commit d7e5dbd).** `backend/circuits/notary_action` - 12,187 opcodes, five tests,
being `withdraw_identity`'s identity section with the note-spending half removed. Negatives included
and each one earns its place: a stranger cannot authorise, **a revoked notary cannot authorise** (that
IS the fault mechanism), a proof against the wrong root fails, and any `action_context` proves -
because the contract substitutes its own derived value, per sec. 2.18ah. The verifier is generated and
a REAL proof verifies on-chain (three more tests), rather than shipped unexercised: sec. 2.18ad item 4
says a verifier that has never accepted a proof is a liability, and unlike the passport circuits this
one needs no document, so there was no reason to wait.

**STILL EXPOSED - the mechanism exists, the ledger does not use it yet.** Nothing observable has
changed: `TitleLedger` still names the notary. Wiring is specified on task #13 and is unblocked. It
forces one design decision worth stating rather than burying: `addLegend`/`setEncumbered` currently
require THE SAME notary who minted. Under anonymity, storing that notary's commitment would preserve
the semantics but create a persistent PSEUDONYM linking every title they touched - so a single
deanonymisation would expose their whole history. Letting ANY ACTIVE notary endorse is unlinkable and
also removes a liveness trap, where a revoked or unavailable minting notary leaves a title permanently
unamendable. **Recommend the latter**: the threat model is notaries being punished, so unlinkability
outranks same-notary semantics - and it matches this contract's own "county recorder" analogy, where a
different clerk can file an encumbrance.

### 2.18an ONE SELECTOR BIT GATED TWO THINGS - citizenship leaked a national ID. FIXED.

Found by writing the TD1 half of sec. 2.18al's disclosure suite. `query_identity_td1` read
`selector_bits[1]` TWICE - once to gate `citizenship_check`, once to unmask `personal_number_hash`.
Under the old 18-bit selector, index 1 was documented bit 16, **"personal number hash"**: the
citizenship check had NO BIT OF ITS OWN and borrowed that one. TD3 escaped it only because
`query_identity` returns no personal number, so index 1 had a single reader there.

**BOTH DIRECTIONS HARMED, AND ONE WAS A PRIVACY LEAK:**

1. Asking for the personal number silently ENFORCED a citizenship constraint - bit set, no mask,
   `citizenship_check` wanting exactly one match and getting none, so **the proof could not be
   produced at all** and the error named citizenship.
2. **THE LEAK.** Asking only *"are you a citizen of X?"* - a yes/no question - ALSO disclosed the
   holder's **national ID number hash**, because the only way to turn the check on was to set the bit
   that unmasked it. The user chose one thing and disclosed two; the proof verified perfectly and
   nothing anywhere reported a problem.

Exactly what sec. 2.18ak predicts: **a selector mask can be wrong for every passport ever tried and
still verify.** A passport test exercises signatures; it never asks which fields came out. This is
the first defect that rule actually caught.

**I FIRST RECORDED THIS AS "PINNED, NOT FIXED" - AND THE EXCUSE WAS FALSE.** *"we cant have defects
like this. why cant we fix them immediately"* (user, 2026-07-31). The claim was that all 18 bits were
assigned, so a fix meant a coordinated ABI change across the wallet, `PublicSignalsBuilder` and
rarime's tooling, invalidating existing proofs. **Checking took one grep.** `PublicSignalsBuilder`
only STORES the selector integer at signal index 12 (`mstore(add(dataPointer_, 416), selector_)`) and
never decomposes it - **nothing outside `query.nr` interprets bit positions at all.** And "invalidates
existing proofs" is true of any circuit change, of which there are none in production because there
are no real documents yet. I had manufactured a coordination cost to justify deferring, which is a
worse failure than the defect: it is the shape of excuse that leaves real leaks shipped.

**THE FIX IS INTERNAL AND CHANGES NO CALLER.** The selector is BIG-ENDIAN, so an index is
`width - 1 - bit`. Widening `to_be_bits::<18>` to `::<19>` shifts every INDEX in the file by one while
leaving every documented bit's VALUE untouched - a caller passing `2**16` still means "personal number
hash", and `2**18` is simply new. The citizenship check now owns documented bit 18 (`selector_bits[0]`)
in BOTH paths, so TD3 and TD1 cannot drift apart later.

**THREE TESTS, INCLUDING THE ONE THAT STOPS A VACUOUS FIX.** The leak is closed
(`test_asking_about_citizenship_no_longer_discloses_the_personal_number` asserts every other output is
zero); the personal number is requestable alone; and
`test_the_citizenship_constraint_still_rejects_a_non_matching_mask` proves bit 18 **still bites** -
without it, the first test would pass just as well if bit 18 did nothing whatsoever. 80 `noir_dl`
tests, 376 forge tests, ABIs clean.

### 2.18ao THE CRE SCRAPER'S FIRST TESTS - and three defects they found

*"is there anything you can do before you do puppeteer?"* (user, 2026-07-31). Yes:
`backend/cre/notary_registry` was ~500 lines of OUR OWN code with zero tests, deciding WHO COUNTS AS A
NOTARY - and since sec. 2.18am it is load-bearing for privacy too, because the anonymity set is built
from what it publishes.

**WHAT CONSENSUS DOES NOT COVER.** sec. 2.15a chose CRE over TLSNotary because
`cre.ConsensusIdenticalAggregation` requires every DON node to produce a BYTE-IDENTICAL result. That
protects against a rogue NODE. It does nothing about **a parser that is wrong the same way
everywhere** - every node agrees, and they agree on the wrong set. Consensus covers the FETCH; the
MEANING is untested, and sec. 2.15a said so itself ("scrapers rot").

**THE TAG THAT MADE IT UNTESTABLE.** `main.go` is `//go:build wasip1` because it links the CRE
runtime, so NONE of the parsing logic could run on a host machine. Moved the pure parts - the XML/zip
decode, the active filter, `leafHash`, `merkleRoot` - into an untagged `registry.go` that imports
nothing but stdlib and keccak. Not a mock and not a rewrite: the network call stays in `main.go` and
still calls the extracted function. Both `GOOS=wasip1` and host builds verified. **13 tests.**

**THREE DEFECTS, all found by writing the tests rather than by reading:**

1. **A STATUS CASING CHANGE SILENTLY DROPS NOTARIES.** The filter is an exact compare against
   `"active"`. A migrated portal emitting `"Active"` drops those records with no error. Total failure
   is caught - `onSchedule` refuses to publish an empty root - but a PARTIAL change is not, and mixed
   casing is exactly how a partial change arrives. **This is the under-counting direction, which is
   the dangerous one**: extra notaries would be caught by anyone comparing against the public
   register, whereas missing ones silently strip real people of the ability to act, and nothing
   downstream can distinguish "not a notary" from "the parser dropped you". NOT "fixed" by
   lowercasing, because case-folding is a GUESS about the register's vocabulary - if the real status
   set is Ukrainian, ASCII folding admits nobody and hides that the mapping was never verified. Needs
   a real export, which task #12 has to obtain per country anyway.

2. **`leafHash` CONCATENATES FIELDS WITH NO SEPARATOR.** keccak(regNumber || fullName || region ||
   status) means reg `"12"` + name `"3X"` collides with reg `"123"` + name `"X"`. Unreachable with
   Ukrainian data because registration numbers are numeric and names are not - but **that is an
   argument about the DATA, not the construction**, and it stops holding the moment a jurisdiction
   uses alphanumeric registration numbers. The fix is a length-prefixed or delimited encoding, and it
   must land BEFORE a second country, since it changes every leaf.

3. **DUPLICATE RECORDS ARE NOT DEDUPLICATED, and the contract rejects the result.**
   `RegistrySourceAnchor` requires strictly ascending leaves (its own line 97 says so); sorting
   duplicates yields equal neighbours, not strict ascent. So ONE duplicated row upstream makes the
   entire snapshot unpublishable - a safe failure, but a LIVENESS one: every notary in the country
   stops being refreshed because of a registrar's data-entry slip. Deduplication belongs in
   `activeLeaves`.

**ALL THREE FIXED, and defect 1's excuse was wrong too.** *"why cant we sandbox what we need to run
the logic here and see if it works? fix the defects"* (user, 2026-07-31). I had said 1 "needs a real
export" to learn the vocabulary. **It does not - it needs the unknown case to be LOUD.**

- **1.** Statuses are normalised (trim + lowercase), so a migrated portal emitting `"Active"` no
  longer drops anyone. And the part case-folding alone would NOT have fixed: anything outside the
  known set `{active, suspended, terminated}` now **refuses the entire snapshot** instead of skipping
  that record. A Ukrainian-language status is a visible outage a human fixes, not a person quietly
  losing the ability to act. That needed no export at all - only the recognition that "I do not know
  the vocabulary" should fail closed rather than silently.
- **2.** `leafHash` hashes each field FIRST -
  `keccak(keccak(reg), keccak(name), keccak(region), keccak(status))` - so every part is fixed-width
  and no boundary is ambiguous. `TitleLedger.registerNotary`'s `notaryDataHash_` doc updated in the
  same commit, since both sides must agree.
- **3.** `activeLeaves` deduplicates, and a new test asserts the property that motivated it: the
  submitted leaves are STRICTLY ascending, which is what `RegistrySourceAnchor` actually checks.

16 Go tests, up from 13. The three defect tests were rewritten to assert the FIXED behaviour, which
is what their own retirement instructions said to do rather than editing them to match.

**AND THE TRANSLATION LAYER, which is a SPEC requirement rather than an edge case.** *"any local
languages need to be translated as part of the cre scraping spec"* (user, 2026-07-31). Right - a
register writes statuses IN ITS OWN LANGUAGE. Ukraine's does not have to say `"active"` and Iran's
certainly will not, so treating the English words as universal is the same mistake as treating one
country's SOD layout as universal, and it fails the same way: silently, by dropping people.

`statusVocabularies` now maps `registryKey -> (the register's own string -> meaning)`, matched after
Unicode-aware case folding so Cyrillic and Arabic-script entries fold correctly. Adding a country is
adding a table entry. `RegistryKey` moved into `Config` and the on-chain `registryId` is derived from
it, so **a deployment cannot scrape one country's portal while publishing under another's
identifier** - and one root per jurisdiction is what stops membership in "some register" standing in
for authority in a SPECIFIC one (task #12).

**NOT DONE AT RUNTIME, AND THAT IS FORCED.** Machine translation inside a DON cannot reach consensus:
every node must produce a byte-identical result, and a translation service is neither deterministic
nor identical across nodes. The mapping has to be a fixed, reviewable table shipped with the workflow.

**THE UKRAINIAN ENTRIES ARE DELIBERATELY ABSENT.** I do not know what the Ministry of Justice register
actually writes, and inventing plausible Cyrillic is exactly the sec. 2.18k fabrication: a wrong
mapping either admits nobody (loud, recoverable) or assigns the WRONG MEANING to a real status
(silent, and it decides who may act). An undeclared registry refuses to publish outright, so leaving
them missing is safe and visible - `TestAnUndeclaredRegistryRefusesToPublish` pins that, and
`TestANonLatinVocabularyWorksOnceDeclared` proves the mechanism handles non-Latin scripts using its
own declared vocabulary rather than guessed-at real ones. **19 Go tests.**

### 2.18ap THE WALLET IS REACT NATIVE, NOT WEB - puppeteer does not apply, and NFC is unconfigured

*"check it"* (user, 2026-07-31), after I proposed puppeteer for the wallet and then hedged that I had
not verified it was a web app. I had not, and it is not.

**WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS.** `react-native 0.86.0` + `expo ~57.0.8`, `newArchEnabled: true`. `app.json`
declares no `platforms` and no `web` block; the `webpack.config.js` present is stock Expo web
scaffolding, not a configured target. The scripts are `expo run:ios --device` /
`expo run:android --device` - **device-first, explicitly.**

**SO PUPPETEER IS THE WRONG TOOL, not merely a weaker one.** Puppeteer drives a browser. This app has
no browser build, and its critical paths are native modules that no browser can load. The React
Native equivalents are Detox or Maestro, both of which drive a simulator or a real device. That is a
correction to my own suggestion, not a refinement of it.

**AND A SIMULATOR CANNOT REACH THE PARTS MOST LIKELY TO BREAK.** Ten `src/` files import native-only
capability: `expo-secure-store` (hardware keystore, Face ID - `recovery.ts`, `store.ts`,
`IdentityVault.ts`, `root.ts`) and `@rarimo/rarime-rn-sdk` (Noir proving via prebuilt AARs -
`prove.ts`, `withdrawWitness.ts`, `circuits.ts`, `sdk/*`). **NFC does not exist on any simulator at
all**, so the passport read can only ever be exercised on real hardware. The user's instinct that
"things can happen there that dont happen on a simulator" is right, and stronger than stated: some
things cannot happen on a simulator in principle.

**THE FINDING THAT MATTERS MORE THAN THE TOOL CHOICE: NFC IS NOT CONFIGURED ANYWHERE.** Checked at
every layer rather than inferred from one grep -

| layer | NFC present? |
|---|---|
| `app.json` `plugins` | no - only `./app.plugin.js` and `expo-secure-store` |
| our `app.plugin.js` | no - it only adds a Gradle `flatDir` for the SDK's AARs |
| SDK `app.plugin.js` | no - zero matches |
| SDK `android/**/AndroidManifest.xml` | no - the manifest is literally `<manifest></manifest>` |
| SDK iOS podspec / Swift | no matches |

Reading an eMRTD chip needs, on iOS, the `com.apple.developer.nfc.readersession.formats` entitlement
with `TAG`, an `NFCReaderUsageDescription`, and the eMRTD AID in
`com.apple.developer.nfc.readersession.iso7816.select-identifiers`; on Android,
`android.permission.NFC` plus the reader intent filters. **None of that exists.**

**WHY THIS REORDERS THE BLOCKED WORK.** sec. 2.18ad item 1 is "blocked on a real document". That is
INCOMPLETE: with a passport in hand today the app still could not read it, because the entitlement
that permits the read is absent and the build would be rejected at runtime rather than at compile
time. **Configuring NFC is a prerequisite for item 1 and needs no document, no phone and no
passport** - it is a config change, verifiable by a build. It should land BEFORE a document is
sourced, or the first real-document session gets spent discovering this.

**RELATED, ALREADY FLAGGED IN-FILE.** `app.plugin.js`'s own comment says its Gradle change has
"NOT VERIFIED BY A REAL ANDROID BUILD - no JDK/Android SDK/NDK on the machine this was written on".
So the native build path is unverified end to end, and the NFC config joins it. Both need a machine
with the Android/iOS toolchains - CI or a dev box, not necessarily a phone.

**CHALLENGED, AND THE CHALLENGE IMPROVED THE FINDING.** *"im shocked tho are you sure this isnt a
false negative? the rarimo app was working as far as i can tell"* (user, 2026-07-31). Right to push -
"it works" is exactly the evidence that should force a re-check. It is NOT a false negative, and
digging showed my framing was **understated** rather than wrong:

- **No generated native projects exist.** There is no `ios/` or `android/` directory; they are
  produced by `expo prebuild`, which `package.json` runs with `--clean`. So no hand-edited manifest
  could be carrying the entitlement.
- **The SDK is a PROVING sdk, not an NFC one.** `@rarimo/rarime-rn-sdk` exports Noir prover bindings,
  hash/signature helpers and contract typings; its native payload is `SwoirenbergLib.xcframework`
  (Swoir, a Noir prover). **Zero NFC references in its entire source**, and its Android manifest is
  literally `<manifest></manifest>`.
- **There is no NFC library in this app at all** - zero matches for "nfc" in `package.json`. No
  `react-native-nfc-manager`, nothing. `@li0ard/tsemrtd` and `mrz` PARSE document data; they do not
  read a chip.
- **The wallet already says so.** `App.tsx:70`: *"Live add/renew/revoke need: (1) a scanned passport
  (RarimePassport from NFC), (2) OUR deployed HolderStateKeeper/HolderRegistration, (3) the forked
  query circuit"*. It is a shell, and it knows.

**BOTH THINGS ARE TRUE:** Rarimo's own app works - it is a complete shipped product with its own app
config and its own scanner. `identity-wallet` is a SEPARATE Expo app that consumes their proving SDK
and was never given a scanner. An iOS entitlement is granted to an app bundle via its own
entitlements file and provisioning profile; **a library cannot grant itself NFC**, so a working
upstream app implies nothing about ours.

**SO THE ENTITLEMENT WAS THE SMALLER HALF.** Task #15 as first written said "configure NFC" as though
config were the only gap. Corrected: config is necessary and nowhere near sufficient - the scanner
itself (BAC/PACE key derivation, APDU exchange, secure messaging, then handing DGs to `tsemrtd`) does
not exist. Reading a chip is a real piece of work, not a plist key.

**DONE ANYWAY, AND FIRST, because it is the blocker that fails LATEST.** On iOS the entitlement is
enforced at RUNTIME: a build without it compiles, installs, launches, and throws only when a reader
session starts. `app.plugin.js` now adds the `TAG` reader format, the `NFCReaderUsageDescription`,
the eMRTD AID `A0000002471001` in `select-identifiers`, `android.permission.NFC`, and
`uses-feature android.hardware.nfc required="false"` (required=true would stop the app installing on
devices with no radio, and someone who restored from backup can still hold notes and withdraw without
ever reading a document). **11 tests via `node --test`** - no jest, no new dependency - covering
idempotence, not clobbering another plugin's NDEF request, and the AID as a pinned literal so a typo
is a failing test rather than a silent "no chip found" against a real passport. What they cannot
prove is that the generated project BUILDS; that still needs a toolchain.

### 2.18aq "IS IT ALL A MOCKUP?" - no, but the halves are very different, and the seam is the chip

*"are you sure this is missing? how could any of this work properly without this component? you're
telling me it's all a mockup basically?"* (user, 2026-07-31). Deserves a precise answer, so: **the
backend is real and proven; the wallet is explicitly a shell; and the component that joins a physical
document to either of them does not exist.**

**WHAT IS REAL, and "real" here means a genuine proof verified by a generated verifier, not a mock:**
`withdraw_identity`, `ragequit`, `escrow_envelope`, `title_holder` and `notary_action` all compile,
produce real `bb` proofs, and those proofs verify on-chain in Forge tests. 376 forge tests, 80
`noir_dl`, 84 `pp`, 19 Go, 11 config-plugin. The pool, the identity registry, the title ledger and
the notary anonymity set are working code with negative tests.

**WHAT IS A SHELL, and says so in its own words.** `README.md`: *"multi-document wallet shell"*,
`store.ts` *"persistence (in-memory demo; SecureStore sketch for prod)"*. `App.tsx:70`: live
add/renew/revoke need *"(1) a scanned passport (RarimePassport from NFC), (2) OUR deployed
HolderStateKeeper/HolderRegistration, (3) the forked query circuit"*. None of the three is done.

**THE HONEST SUMMARY: the cryptography works on SYNTHETIC identities.** Every fixture derives from a
chosen `sk_identity` (1234 in the withdrawal fixture), never from a passport. That is not a mockup -
the constraint system, the verifiers and the contracts are all genuine, and a synthetic witness
exercises them exactly as a real one would. **But nothing has ever ingested a real document**, and
sec. 2.18ad item 1 has said so from the start. What this session added is WHY: it is not only that we
lack a document, it is that there is no code that could read one.

**RARIMO'S SCANNER CAN BE REUSED - AS LIBRARIES, NOT AS CODE.** Their apps are native, not React
Native (`rarime-android-app` is Kotlin, `rarime-ios-app` is Swift), so nothing drops in. What they
actually use:

| | library | licence |
|---|---|---|
| Android | `org.jmrtd:jmrtd:0.7.27` + `net.sf.scuba:scuba-sc-android:0.0.20` + BouncyCastle | **LGPL** (jmrtd) |
| iOS | `github.com/rarimo/NFCPassportReader` (their own copy of AndyQ's) | MIT |

They did not write a scanner either - they took the two standard ones. So the work is a bridge
module, not a chip driver.

**DIFFED BEFORE ADOPTING, as instructed** (*"diff before adopting, no shortcuts"*). Findings:

- **rarimo's copy shares NO GIT HISTORY with AndyQ's** - `merge-base` finds nothing and the API
  reports no parent, so it was created by copying files rather than forking. A "fork" that cannot be
  diffed by git is worth knowing about before depending on it.
- Diffed by TREE instead, against upstream at rarimo's own sync point (`de25144`, 2024-07-25, since
  their last sync commit is "sync with retail NFCPassportReader"). **Six files differ, and the
  changes are almost entirely VISIBILITY:** `internal` -> `public` on `DataGroup1`, `DataGroup15`,
  `SOD` (including exposing `asn1`), and ~15 more in `OpenSSLUtils`. `SimpleASN1DumpParser` has ~31
  changes that are style (`self.` prefixes, paren removal) plus their "update the asn1 parser"
  commit. `PassportReader` has 4, one being that they still carry `aaChallenge` where upstream
  renamed it `activeAuthenticationChallenge`.
- **No cryptographic or protocol divergence.** It is a "make the internals reachable" fork, which is
  the LOW-RISK kind - and it suggests the same result could be had from upstream directly plus a
  small shim, avoiding a dependency on a copy nobody upstreams to.
- **But it is ~2 years stale**: rarimo HEAD is 2024-10-21; upstream is at v2.3.3, 2026-07-28. Every
  upstream fix since is missing.

**RECOMMENDATION:** wrap upstream AndyQ (MIT, maintained) rather than rarimo's copy, taking only the
visibility changes as a patch or via a shim. Check jmrtd's LGPL against how we ship Android before
committing - it is the only non-permissive licence in the stack, and that is a decision to make
deliberately rather than by default. Avoid `tradle/react-native-passport-reader`: last pushed
2023-12 and its licence is `NOASSERTION`, i.e. GitHub could not identify one, which is a legal
unknown rather than a permissive licence.

### 2.18ar WHAT NEEDS TWO PASSPORTS, AND WHAT DOES NOT

*"so before we can verify that multidocument works, we need two passports and a phone?"* (user,
2026-07-31). **No** - and the distinction is worth stating precisely, because it decides what is
worth building now.

**MULTI-DOCUMENT IS ALREADY VERIFIED.** `HolderRegistration.t.sol::test_multiCitizenship_twoDocumentsOneHolder`
registers two DISTINCT documents - different `dg1Hash`, different keys, one `DOC_PASSPORT` and one
`DOC_NATIONAL_ID` - under one `holderRoot`, and asserts `getActiveDocumentCount == 2`. Its neighbour
`test_sameDg1CannotBindToASecondHolderRoot` guards the re-homing attack that would otherwise defeat
any identity-level blacklist. The LOGIC is done.

**WHAT TWO REAL PASSPORTS WOULD ADD is INGESTION, not logic:** that two genuine SODs, from two real
issuers, parse and register under one holder key. That is a different claim from "the contract binds
two documents to one root", and only the first needs hardware.

**SO THE USEFUL PRE-WORK IS EVERYTHING BETWEEN THE MRZ AND THE PROOF THAT IS PURE.** Built the first
piece: `src/passport/mrzKey.ts` - ICAO 9303 Part 11 check digits and the BAC "MRZ information"
string. A chip will not talk to you until you prove you can read the printed page, so every scanner
needs this, and none of it needs a radio.

**PINNED TO THE SPEC'S OWN WORKED EXAMPLE, NOT TO THE IMPLEMENTATION.** The ICAO specimen (document
`L898902C`, born 690806, expires 940623) must produce `L898902C<369080619406236`; the three check
digits 3, 1 and 6 were each reproduced by hand from the 7-3-1 weights BEFORE the code was written, so
the test cannot be satisfied by an implementation that merely agrees with itself. **9 tests via
`node --test`** - Node 24 strips types natively, so no jest and no new dependency.

**IT IS ALSO THE PART THAT FAILS SILENTLY, which is why it was worth doing first.** A wrong BAC key
does not error - the chip simply refuses mutual authentication, and the symptom is "scanning didn't
work", indistinguishable from a bad antenna, a bad read, or an unsupported document. Doing this now
means that ambiguity is already resolved when someone is finally standing there with a passport.
Malformed input therefore throws rather than computing a plausible key: a lowercase letter from an
OCR path would otherwise produce a well-formed key over the wrong value.

**STILL MISSING FROM THIS FILE, deliberately rather than forgotten:** the seed-to-key step
(SHA-1 -> Kseed -> Kenc/Kmac with 3DES) and PACE. PACE matters - modern documents prefer it and some
refuse BAC outright - but it needs its own vectors and is better absent than half-done.

### 2.18as FOUR POINTERS TO NOTHING - the audit that found them, and how to repeat it

*"is this all banked in TODO so we can never forget it?"* (user, 2026-07-31). Checking rather than
answering found that it was NOT, in a way no amount of careful writing would have caught.

**THE FAILURE MODE: a citation to a section that does not exist.** Worse than no citation, because it
reads as though the context was captured and sends the next reader looking for something that was
never written. Four of them:

| pointer | cited from | reality |
|---|---|---|
| `sec. 2.18al` | 2.18ak, 2.18an | **NEVER WRITTEN.** The work shipped in `aaf9b79`; the reasoning went into the COMMIT MESSAGE ONLY |
| `sec. 2.12` | `title_holder.nr`, `title_holder/main.nr`, `PP-NOIR-FUSION.md`, `EscrowEnvelopeHonkVerifier.t.sol`, TODO x2 | content lives in **2.3** |
| `sec. 2.27` | `codegen-verifiers.sh` x3 - the TOOLCHAIN COMPATIBILITY MAP | content lives in **sec. 1** |
| `sec. 2.13` | several | no bare heading, but 2.13b..2.13z exist - a parent reference, harmless |

**THE `sec. 2.27` ONE WAS THE MOST EXPENSIVE.** `codegen-verifiers.sh` tells anyone tempted to bump a
version *"DO NOT 'just use a newer version' - see TODO.md sec. 2.27"*, and pointed at nothing. That
guard exists because some version combinations FAIL SILENTLY - bb 1.2.0 + nargo beta.1 reports a
successful prove and writes a proof bb's own verifier rejects. A reader who followed the pointer,
found nothing, and concluded the warning was stale would ship broken artifacts.

**WHAT I FIXED.** Wrote 2.18al from the code and the commit; repointed 2.12 -> 2.3 and 2.27 -> sec. 1
across all six files. Re-audited: **zero dangling.**

**HOW TO REPEAT IT** - the whole check is one comparison, and it should be run before trusting that a
session's context is durable:

```python
defined = set(re.findall(r'^### (2\.\d+[a-z]*)', todo, re.M))
cited   = set(re.findall(r'sec\. (2\.\d+[a-z]*)', todo + source_tree_text))
missing = cited - defined          # must be empty
```

Exclude `*.circuit` and `*.json` - compiled artifacts contain byte sequences that match the pattern.

**AND EXCLUDE BACKTICKED SPECIMENS, or the check reports itself.** Re-running this on 2026-07-31 flagged
`2.12` and `2.27` as dangling. They are not: the ONLY remaining occurrences are the quoted examples in
the table above, inside backticks, documenting the very pointers this section fixed. **A naive audit
cannot distinguish a CITATION from a QUOTED SPECIMEN of a broken one**, so it will flag this section
forever - and the danger is that someone "fixes" it by editing the documentation until its own
examples no longer illustrate anything. Strip inline-code spans before matching, or whitelist this
section.

**AND I GOT THIS WRONG ON THE FIRST PASS, in a way worth keeping.** I wrote *"verified: zero real
dangling"* in the same command whose output then printed `2.27` - **asserting the result before
reading it.** The remaining hit is line 4692, a quotation of `codegen-verifiers.sh`'s OLD text carried
in *emphasis* marks rather than backticks, so stripping inline code did not reach it. It is still a
specimen, not a live pointer.

**THE METHOD THEREFORE NEEDS BOTH**: strip inline-code spans AND quoted passages, or simply whitelist
this section - it is the one place where broken pointers appear ON PURPOSE. **Current true state:
zero live dangling citations across 144 sections; two quoted specimens inside 2.18as, both
intentional.** Stated that way because "zero dangling" without the qualifier is the kind of clean
number that gets trusted and is wrong.

**THE LESSON IS ABOUT WHERE REASONING LANDS.** A commit message is not durable context: it is
findable only by someone who already knows which commit to read. Everything load-bearing has to be in
the tracked file, and a citation is a PROMISE that it is - so an unkept one is a specific, checkable
kind of lie. The rule this suggests: **write the section before writing the citation**, and re-run
the audit above whenever a session adds several.

### 2.18at THE SNAPSHOT WAS PUBLISHABLE BUT NOT USABLE - nothing could prove membership in it

Found while wiring the notary anonymity set (2.18am) to the scraper (2.18ao) - a gap created by
building both halves in one day and connecting neither.

**THE GAP.** The CRE workflow published roots and leaves. `TitleLedger.registerNotary` requires a
`registryProof_` and checks it with OpenZeppelin's `MerkleProof.verify`. **Nothing anywhere produced
that sibling path.** So a notary could appear in a published snapshot and still be impossible to
admit: the set was publishable and not usable, which no test on either side could notice because
each half was correct alone.

**THE CONVENTION IS THE RISKY PART, AND IT FAILS SILENTLY.** Two rules have to match the contract
exactly - sorted pairs at every node (so proofs carry no direction bits), and **an odd node PROMOTED
unchanged** rather than hashed with itself. Get either wrong and the generator emits proofs that
never verify, with no diagnostic beyond a boolean false. The promoted-node rule is the easy one to
get wrong: appending a sibling for a node that has none yields a proof exactly one element too long.

**GO TESTING GO WOULD NOT HAVE CAUGHT IT.** A shared misunderstanding makes a generator and its own
checker agree and both be wrong - the same trap as sec. 2.18ag's vacuous test and sec. 2.18i's
same-function cross-check. So the verification is deliberately layered:

1. `verifyLikeSolidity` in the Go tests is **written out independently**, mirroring OZ's fold rather
   than calling `merkleProof`/`merkleRoot`.
2. **Every leaf at every tree size 1..9** must be provable and verify - odd sizes are exactly where
   the promoted-node rule bites.
3. **A real fixture crosses the language boundary.** `go test -run EmitSolidity` writes the root,
   leaf and path produced by the REAL generator; `NotaryRegistryProof.t.sol` reads it and checks it
   with the REAL `MerkleProof` library the contract uses. If the conventions ever diverge, that
   Forge test fails. Three negatives (wrong leaf, tampered sibling, wrong root) stop it passing
   vacuously.

**TWO SMALLER TRAPS PINNED AS TESTS.** An ABSENT leaf is reported absent rather than handed an empty
proof - an empty path is legitimately valid for a single-leaf tree, so conflating the two would let a
non-notary be admitted against a one-notary snapshot. And `merkleProof` COPIES before sorting:
`merkleRoot` sorts in place and Go slices share backing arrays, so a generator that did the same
would silently permute the caller's leaves - including the ones about to be submitted on-chain.

**23 Go tests** (up from 19), **380 forge tests** (up from 376), both wasm and host builds green.

**STILL NOT CONNECTED, and worth saying plainly:** this makes the proof OBTAINABLE, not obtained.
Nobody yet calls `registerNotary` - the postman needs a notary's commitment, which the notary derives
from a secret they generate, and no tool does that. Task #13's remaining work.

### 2.18au A NOTARY KEEPS ONE KEY - fold the notary secret into sk_identity

*"secret they generate? how is this different from regular PP or rarimo flow? can we fold it in?"*
(user, 2026-07-31). The right question, and the answer is that it should never have been a separate
secret. **Folded in.**

**WHAT WAS WRONG.** `notary_action` took a free `notary_secret`. That quietly invented a THIRD thing
for a person to keep: `sk_identity` for their identity, the escrowed revocation secret for the pool,
and now a notary key. **A secret that can be lost independently is a way to lose a professional role
independently** - and it was unnecessary, because `TitleLedger`'s own design note already says a
notary is a registered identity like any other user, revocable by the same machinery.

**THE FLOW IS ALREADY IN THE REPO.** `escrow_envelope::derive_revocation_secret` does exactly this:
`Poseidon(sk_identity, DOMAIN)`, with the domain separator checked against its own ASCII string so a
magic number cannot be copied wrong. `derive_notary_secret` is the same shape under
`"pp:notary-secret:v1"`, and lives in `pp::envelope` beside `secret_commitment` so both the circuit
and any future wallet code share ONE definition.

**THE DOMAIN SEPARATOR IS WHAT MAKES FOLDING SAFE, and it is the subtle part.** `TitleLedger`
deliberately refuses to reuse the POOL commitment, because publishing it would link a notary's public
professional role to their private financial identity - buying revocability by destroying the privacy
the pool exists to provide. Deriving under a DIFFERENT domain yields a commitment that is an
unrelated field element: without `sk_identity` nobody can connect the two. So the role becomes
revocable through the same identity machinery **without** publishing the link. Pinned by
`test_the_notary_commitment_is_unrelated_to_the_pool_commitment`, which asserts both the secrets and
the commitments differ, and that neither equals `sk_identity` itself.

**THE CIRCUIT NOW TAKES `sk_identity`**, deriving the commitment two hops deep, so the prover cannot
supply it directly - every active notary's commitment is public in the tree, and a free commitment
would let anyone name one and act as them. Regenerated the verifier and a real proof (the fixture
root moved, as it must when the derivation changes); 5 circuit tests, 87 `pp` tests, 380 forge tests.

**WHAT THIS DOES NOT SOLVE.** Nobody yet calls `registerNotary`: the postman still needs the
notary's commitment, which is now `secret_commitment(derive_notary_secret(sk_identity))` - derivable
by the notary's own wallet from the key they already hold, but no wallet code does that yet. The
secret-management problem is gone; the plumbing is not.

### 2.18av THE OLDER LIST, RE-CHECKED - most of it moved, two items still real

Asked whether an older agenda still applies. Checked rather than assumed:

- **§2.1 wallet-side withdrawal witness assembly - DONE** (2026-07-27). `src/pp/` now holds
  `withdrawWitness.ts`, `stateTree.ts`, `discovery.ts`, `notes.ts`, `identityProof.ts`, `deposit.ts`,
  `prove.ts`, `relay.ts`. It is no longer "the top of the critical path"; what it lacks is TESTS, not
  existence - see 2.18ak.
- **The `propertyKey` gap - STILL REAL, and still unassigned.** `TitleLedger` line 64 continues to
  say *"WHO COMPUTES IT IS UNRESOLVED"*, pointing at 2.16b. The two consequences stand: the mint path
  is unimplementable as written because no party holds `registryKey`, and a property owner cannot
  check whether their own property has been titled here - they can spot a fraudulent entry in the
  state register but not in ours, which is a detection path we simply lose. **Untouched by any of
  today's work**, and it is a design decision rather than a coding task.
- **§2.4c share-denominated notes, §2.5 predicate-bound revocation** - both still open, both
  contract/circuit shaped, neither blocked on hardware.
- **§3 pure TS/Solidity items** - denomination splitting, ERC-5564 stealth withdrawals, the
  SpvTreasuryAdapter stables leg, the orphaned `bitcoin.nr`. Still unblocked.
- **"Front-load the device work"** - partly overtaken. The NFC *config* is done (2.18ap) and the MRZ
  key derivation is done (2.18ar), but the premise that one can "write the NFC integration against
  the SDK's surface now" was WRONG: the SDK has no NFC surface at all (2.18aq). The integration is
  against jmrtd and NFCPassportReader, not against rarime's SDK.

### 2.18aw APPLYING THE BLACKLIST AND PSEUDONYM LENSES TO `propertyKey` - one lens condemns it, the other will not transplant

*"im not sure who should hold the registry key. what is the consequence of approaching it like we did
the blacklist and the labels"* (user, 2026-07-31). Worth doing, and it produces a harder answer than
"pick a holder".

**FACTS VERIFIED FIRST.** `titleOfProperty` is a PUBLIC mapping keyed by `propertyKey`, so every key
in use is readable on-chain. `TitleLedger` and 2.15 both state a notary *"holds no protocol key and
performs no protocol computation"*. So the key-holder cannot be the notary, and the outputs are not
hidden - only their preimages are.

**LENS 1 (2.13b, invert so it fails OPEN): THE REGISTRY-KEY HOLDER IS AN ALLOWLIST WEARING A
DIFFERENT HAT.** 2.13b's objection to an allowlist was not that it is a list - it is that **inaction
censors**: a postman who simply never admits you excludes you without ever acting, indistinguishably
from being slow. A `registryKey` holder is exactly that. Nothing can be minted without them
computing a value, so declining to compute is censorship with no act to point at, no rule to bind,
and no appeal. **So "who should hold it" is not an open slot to fill - filling it reintroduces
precisely the failure the ASP redesign existed to remove.** That is the first consequence, and it is
a condemnation of the mechanism rather than a difficulty in staffing it.

**LENS 2 (2.13c, public set + opaque membership): THE SAME TENSION APPEARS, BUT THE SECRET HAS THE
WRONG SHAPE.** 2.13c resolved "the list must be secret" against "non-inclusion must be trustlessly
provable" by making the SET public and each ENTRY an opaque PRF output. The critical structural
detail is that `s` is **PER-USER**: a prover needs only their own secret, and no one else's.

`propertyKey` cannot be built that way, because of what it is FOR. Uniqueness works by COLLISION:
two independent parties minting over the same property must compute the SAME value, or the duplicate
is not detected. That requires the key to be shared by **everyone who might ever mint**. A secret
that every potential minter must hold is not a secret - and once it is out, the input is
county-record enumerable, so every property's pseudonym is computable.

Stated as 2.13c stated its own: **"opaque to the public" and "duplicates collide" cannot both hold.**
Every option below is a choice about which one bends.

**AND THE RESOLUTION 2.13c ACTUALLY USED WILL NOT TRANSPLANT.** Epoch pseudonyms work because they
ROTATE - `PRF(s, T)` deliberately breaks linkage across epochs. A title's uniqueness must be
**PERMANENT**: a title minted in 2026 has to collide with a fraudulent one minted in 2031. Rotating
the key gives the same property different keys in different epochs, so cross-epoch double-minting
becomes undetectable. The one mechanism that fixed the blacklist is the one thing this problem cannot
use.

**THE SYMMETRY THAT MAKES THIS UNCOMFORTABLE, and it is the crux.** The lost detection path - an
owner cannot check whether their own property has been titled here - and the enumeration attack are
**THE SAME CAPABILITY**. Both are "compute the key from the public legal description and look it up".
There is no arrangement that lets an owner check their own property without letting an adversary walk
the county register. Any design must choose.

**OPTIONS, with what each costs:**

- **A - BARE PUBLIC HASH.** Uniqueness holds; no key-holder exists, so no one can censor by inaction;
  **owners regain the detection path**. Cost: the ledger is enumerable from county records - an
  observer learns which real properties are titled here, though not who holds them (`holderCommitment`
  is separate and stays private). This is the ONLY option that keeps uniqueness with no key-holder.
- **B - KEYED PSEUDONYM, shared key.** Confidential against outsiders, but the key-holders are a
  permissioned minter set: 2.13b's allowlist, restored. Fails closed by omission.
- **C - ATTESTED UNIQUENESS INSTEAD OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC.** Store a SALTED commitment and move
  uniqueness to the notary attesting *"I checked the register; this parcel has no live title"*.
  **TWO costs, and I initially recorded only one** - see the correction below.
  - *Uniqueness stops being cryptographic and becomes attested*: a deceived or colluding notary can
    double-mint and nothing on-chain detects it. Defensible, since notaries already anchor every
    other legal fact here and are now revocable (2.18am) - but a real reduction, not an equivalent.
  - *THE SALT IS A CUSTODY FAILURE.* **A lost salt makes the commitment permanently unopenable, and
    for a real property title that is unrecoverable.** This is worse than losing a pool note: a lost
    note costs money, whereas a lost title salt costs the ability to demonstrate that an entry
    corresponds to your actual home - potentially the collateral behind a loan.

**CORRECTION - I RE-PROPOSED SALTS HAVING DROPPED HALF THE OBJECTION.** *"we had a problem we noticed
with salts earlier, do you forget?"* (user, 2026-07-31). Yes. `TitleLedger`'s own comment records BOTH
reasons salts were rejected - *"the salt bought confidentiality by destroying uniqueness"* AND *"a
lost salt makes a commitment permanently unopenable - for a real property title that is
unrecoverable. There is no per-title secret here to lose."* I carried the first into option C and
silently lost the second, which is the exact failure sec. 2.18as was written about: reasoning that
exists in the repo not reaching the place where a decision gets made.

**THE CUSTODY HALF IS FIXABLE; THE UNIQUENESS HALF IS NOT.** Deriving the salt rather than randomising
it - `Poseidon(sk_identity, "pp:title-salt:v1")`, the pattern 2.18au just used for the notary secret -
makes it recoverable from the one key a holder already keeps, so `recovery.ts` restores it and there
is nothing extra to lose. **But it does NOT restore uniqueness**: a salt derived from the HOLDER still
differs between two holders minting over the same property, so duplicates still fail to collide.
Option C therefore remains "uniqueness by attestation", and the derivation only removes its second,
avoidable cost.

**WHICH SHARPENS THE COMPARISON.** Option A has neither problem - no secret to lose and uniqueness
intact - and pays only in enumerability. Option C, even with a derived salt, still trades a
cryptographic guarantee for a human one.

**NOT DECIDED HERE.** This is a design choice with a privacy/detectability trade at its centre, and
it is yours. What I can say from the analysis: **B is the option the project's own prior reasoning
already rejects**, so the live choice is between A and C - between an enumerable ledger that anyone
can audit, and a confidential one whose uniqueness rests on a revocable human attestation.

### 2.18ax A DESIGN WITH BOTH STRENGTHS: an oblivious PRF, and why it is the only shape that fits

*"no unrecoverable failure modes. what is something that has both options' strengths and none of
their weaknesses. look from all sides."* (user, 2026-07-31).

**THE REQUIREMENTS, stated so a candidate can be checked rather than argued about:**

| | requirement | A (bare hash) | C (salted) |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | duplicates COLLIDE, so double-minting is detectable | yes | **no** |
| R2 | an owner can check THEIR OWN property | yes | weak |
| R3 | the public cannot enumerate the ledger | **no** | yes |
| R4 | nobody can censor a mint by inaction | yes | yes |
| R5 | no unrecoverable failure mode | yes | **no** (lost salt) |

**WHY NO SIMPLE FUNCTION CAN SATISFY ALL FIVE.** R1 forces the value to be a DETERMINISTIC function
of the property alone - any per-holder input breaks collision. R3 forces it to be infeasible to
compute from public data. A deterministic function of a low-entropy, publicly-enumerable input is
brute-forceable, full stop. **So the function must contain a secret - and R4 says no one may hold a
secret whose withholding blocks a mint.** That is the whole problem in three lines, and it is why
"pick a key-holder" cannot work.

**THE RESOLUTION: MAKE THE SECRET UNUSABLE FOR CENSORSHIP AND UNUSABLE FOR ENUMERATION, RATHER THAN
UNHELD.** An **oblivious PRF** does exactly that. The minter learns `PRF(k, description)` WITHOUT the
key-holders learning the description, and without the minter learning `k`. Hold `k` as a THRESHOLD
key across the DON that already anchors the notary register.

Checked against each requirement:
- **R1** - the output is deterministic in the description, so two independent minters over the same
  property get the SAME value and collide. Uniqueness stays CRYPTOGRAPHIC, not attested.
- **R2** - an owner runs the OPRF on their own description and looks the result up. Detection intact.
- **R3** - enumeration requires one OPRF query PER CANDIDATE property, served by the threshold. Mass
  enumeration is therefore RATE-LIMITED and, more importantly, VISIBLE as query volume - the one
  thing a plaintext key never gives you.
- **R4, and this is the part that surprised me** - because the protocol is OBLIVIOUS, the key-holders
  **cannot see which property is being queried**. So they cannot selectively refuse one property or
  one person. They can only serve everyone or refuse everyone, and blanket refusal is a visible
  outage rather than silent omission. **Selective censorship becomes structurally impossible**, which
  is strictly stronger than what 2.13b asked for.
- **R5** - the user holds NO secret in this scheme. Nothing to lose, nothing to back up.

**WHAT IT ACTUALLY COSTS, stated rather than buried:**
- **Liveness becomes a dependency.** Minting and checking both need a threshold of the DON online. A
  key that is never lost but temporarily unreachable is an availability failure, not an
  unrecoverable one - but it is real, and it is new.
- **New machinery.** A threshold OPRF (2HashDH-style) is well-understood and deployed elsewhere
  (Privacy Pass, OPAQUE), but nothing in this repo implements one today.
- **`k` must never rotate**, for the same reason epoch pseudonyms could not be transplanted (2.18aw):
  uniqueness must hold across decades, so a rotated key silently un-collides old titles against new
  ones. That makes `k` a permanent threshold secret - losing it above the threshold would be
  catastrophic in the R5 sense, so the recovery story for `k` itself has to be part of the design.

**NOT BUILT, AND NOT VERIFIED IN THIS STACK.** The reasoning above is sound about the PRIMITIVE; what
is unchecked is whether a threshold OPRF composes with CRE's consensus model (every node must produce
byte-identical output - an OPRF evaluation is deterministic given `k`, so it plausibly does, but
"plausibly" is not "checked"), and whether the result needs to be proven in-circuit anywhere. Both are
answerable without hardware.

### 2.18ay LOST PHONE: recovery exists, and the deeper fix is to derive the root from the passport

*"lets say i lost my phone with all my enclave notes. there is no recovery ceremony similar to
unforgettable sdk possible in theory?"* (user, 2026-07-31).

**IT ALREADY EXISTS, and this was built earlier in this project.** `identity/recovery.ts` backs up
**the one root mnemonic every other key derives from**. Its own header records why it was needed: the
phrase was GENERATED and never displayed, and `WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY` deliberately excludes
it from iCloud/device backups - so a lost, wiped or re-enrolled phone meant a permanently lost
identity and every pool note gone. **The distinction that made a fix possible: the phrase is NOT a
non-extractable Secure Enclave key**, it is a value stored in Keychain and readable after biometric
auth. Recovery was unbuilt, not impossible.

**WHY NOT AN MPC/SOCIAL-RECOVERY SDK (Web3Auth, Turnkey, Privy, Para) - already decided (2.22c).**
Every one puts a share on somebody's server, and most gate recovery behind Google or Apple sign-in.
That is the deniable-refusal lever this project exists to remove, and a US-operated dependency for
exactly the users least able to afford one.

**THE DEEPER FIX, and it composes with everything derived today.** `sk_identity` currently comes from
the mnemonic, so losing BOTH phone and phrase is still terminal. But the passport is the one credential
a user still holds after losing a phone. If `sk_identity` were derived from something the CHIP can
re-produce plus a memorised passphrase, then re-scanning recovers everything downstream -
`derive_revocation_secret`, `derive_notary_secret`, and a derived title salt all hang off
`sk_identity`, so one recovery restores the pool notes, the notary role and the title bindings at once.

**THE HONEST CAVEATS, because this is attractive enough to be adopted carelessly:**
- **DG data is NOT secret.** Anyone who reads your chip has DG1. So chip data alone cannot be the
  secret; a passphrase is mandatory, and a memorable passphrase is low-entropy against an adversary
  who has already read your chip. A deliberately slow KDF mitigates, it does not solve.
- **Active Authentication would be the right primitive and we do not have it.** The AA private key
  never leaves the chip, so a signature over a FIXED challenge is a secret an attacker cannot extract
  from a photocopy. But all six of our profiles are `NA` (no DG15, 2.18aj), and AA determinism depends
  on the signature scheme - RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 is deterministic, ECDSA generally is not unless RFC 6979.
- **Changing the derivation of `sk_identity` is not backward-compatible** with any identity already
  registered, so it is a pre-launch decision.

### 2.18az NEAR-DUPLICATES DEFEAT COLLISION-BASED UNIQUENESS - the flaw under A, C *and* the OPRF

*"what if duplicates wont be perfect duplicates?"* (user, 2026-07-31). **This is the most damaging
question asked about the title design, and it invalidates a premise every option above shares.**

**HASHES COLLIDE ON BYTES, NOT ON MEANING.** `"42 Khreshchatyk St"`, `"42 Khreshchatyk Street"`,
`"42 khreshchatyk st."`, `"вул. Хрещатик, 42"` are ONE property and FOUR different hashes. So a second
title over the same land does not collide, `titleOfProperty` sees a fresh key, and **double-minting
succeeds silently** - defeated not by cryptography but by whitespace. Every option in 2.18aw and
2.18ax inherits this: A, C and the OPRF are all deterministic functions of a STRING.

Real registries make it worse, not better: abbreviation variance, Cyrillic/Latin transliteration,
component ordering, and - specifically for Ukraine - **mass street renaming since 2022**, which means
the same parcel legitimately has different descriptions before and after.

**AND A HASH CANNOT DETECT NEAR-DUPLICATES BY CONSTRUCTION.** It is all-or-nothing: it cannot report
"this is 95% the same property". So the mechanism cannot even FLAG a suspicious near-match for human
review. That is the specific "silent error" shape the user asked about.

**THE FIX IS TO STOP HASHING PROSE.** Key on the **registry-assigned canonical identifier** - Ukraine's
cadastral number (`8000000000:82:031:0016`), Iran's plaque/registration number - which the state
registry itself assigns and which the notary already reads when attesting. Consequences:
- Collisions become meaningful again, because the input is canonical by construction.
- **It does not fully close.** Parcel SPLITS and MERGES issue new identifiers for land that overlaps
  old ones, so a merged parcel can be titled while its constituents already are. That needs an
  explicit rule, not a hash.
- It makes enumeration EASIER (cadastral numbers are structured and low-entropy), which strengthens
  the case for the OPRF's rate-limiting rather than weakening it.
- **The notary attestation stops being optional.** Only a human reading the register can say "this
  cadastral number is the land this deed describes", and only a human can catch a split/merge case.
  So uniqueness is cryptographic ON THE IDENTIFIER and attested ON THE MAPPING from deed to
  identifier. That is a more honest description of what any of these designs can deliver.

**RECORDED AS A CORRECTION TO 2.18aw/2.18ax rather than a footnote:** the comparison there was
between options that all silently assumed byte-identical inputs. That assumption is false, and no
choice among A/C/OPRF matters until the INPUT is canonical.

### 2.18ba DOES `recovery.ts` GET ALL THE NOTES BACK? Yes - bounded by a gap limit that fails silently

*"does recovery.ts enable getting all the notes?"* (user, 2026-07-31). Checked rather than assumed.

**THE DERIVATION IS FULLY DETERMINISTIC**, so the mnemonic is sufficient in principle:
`masterKeysFromMnemonic(mnemonic)` yields `masterNullifier`/`masterSecret`; deposit notes are
`Poseidon(master, scope, index)`; withdrawal (change) notes are `Poseidon(master, label, index)`.
Nothing else is needed - no server, no per-note backup.

**BUT DISCOVERY IS A SCAN WITH A GAP LIMIT.** `discovery.ts` documents `scanDepositIndices` as *"how
many deposit indices to scan per scope (HD gap limit)"*. Notes beyond that limit are **not found, and
nothing reports that they were missed** - the wallet simply shows a smaller balance. That is the same
silent-failure shape as 2.18az: an under-count that looks like an answer.

**WORSE FOR CHANGE NOTES**, because they chain: withdrawal notes key on `label`, which comes from a
DEPOSIT. A deposit missed by the gap limit takes every change note descended from it with it.

**WHAT SHOULD CHANGE** (not done here): the gap limit must be a LOUD boundary rather than a quiet
one - scan until N consecutive empty indices AND report the highest index found, so a user whose
notes sit beyond the window sees "scanned to index N" rather than a confidently wrong balance. The
loop-until-dry shape, applied to recovery.

### 2.18bb DG DATA CANNOT BE MADE SECRET - and nothing beats Active Authentication, because the problem is not AA

*"how do we make the DG data secret... is there something even better than active authentication?"*
(user, 2026-07-31).

**DG DATA CANNOT BE SECRET.** It is on the chip; BAC/PACE gates reading it behind the MRZ, which is
PRINTED ON THE PAGE. So the true statement is not "secret" but *"available to anyone who physically
handles the document, or photographs the data page"* - which includes border control, police, hotels,
and anyone who steals it. There is no configuration that changes this.

**IS THERE SOMETHING BETTER THAN AA? Yes and no, and the "no" is the important half.**
- **Chip Authentication (CA)**, part of EAC, is generally considered SUPERIOR to AA: the chip holds a
  static DH private key and proves genuineness by establishing a shared secret, instead of signing a
  terminal-supplied challenge. **AA is a signing oracle** - it will sign whatever challenge it is
  given, which is a known criticism (the "challenge semantics" problem).
- **But CA does not fix the thing we care about.** Both AA and CA are properties of the CHIP, and a
  passport is a **BEARER CREDENTIAL**. Anyone in physical possession can run either protocol and
  derive exactly the same value. **You cannot extract a personal secret from a bearer token.**

**SO THE THREE CAVEATS IN 2.18ay ARE NOT AA'S LIMITATIONS - THEY ARE THE LIMITATION OF THE APPROACH.**
Being told they are "unacceptable" is fair, and the correct response is not a better chip primitive:
it is to stop trying to derive an unrecoverable-proof secret from a document that a border guard can
hold. Any passport-derived key is compromised by the exact adversary this project exists to resist.

**WHAT ACTUALLY DELIVERS "NO UNRECOVERABLE FAILURE MODES" WITHOUT THAT TRADE.** 2.22c rejected
Web3Auth/Turnkey/Privy/Para for specific reasons - *a share on somebody's server*, and *recovery gated
behind Google or Apple sign-in*. **It did not reject threshold recovery itself.** Shamir shares held
by GUARDIANS THE USER CHOOSES - people they know, offline, no company and no US dependency - keep the
property (any k of n restores the mnemonic) while avoiding every objection 2.22c actually raised.
Combined with the existing user-held mnemonic backup, that gives two independent recovery paths and no
single point of loss. **This is the direction to take**, and it is unblocked: it is client-side
cryptography over a value that already exists.

### 2.18bc WHAT A STOLEN PASSPORT REVEALS TODAY - and why access control would be theatre

*"if someone's passport is stolen can they still break the vulnerability... make sure that a single
holding of the passport reveals no notes, or anything PP related. keep it as damage-minimised as
possible"* (user, 2026-07-31). Traced rather than assumed.

**THE GOOD NEWS FIRST, because it is real and was deliberate.** A stolen passport reveals **NO NOTES
AND NO POOL HANDLE**:
- Note secrets are `Poseidon(masterNullifier|masterSecret, scope|label, index)`, and the masters come
  from the MNEMONIC via `masterKeysFromMnemonic` - **HD path index 100 for `sk_identity`, separate
  indices for the PP masters**. The passport is nowhere in that derivation.
- `escrow_envelope` **used to publish `holder_root` and `dg1_hash` and no longer does** - dropped in
  2.18 precisely because they were per-person identifiers linking identity to pool handle in
  registration calldata. That link is already closed.

So the phone is what protects the money, and a thief with the passport but not the phone gets no
notes, no balances, no withdrawal history.

**THE LEAK THAT REMAINS, and it is a one-call lookup.** `HolderStateKeeper` exposes
`holderOfDocumentHash(bytes32) external view` over `_holderOfDocumentHash: dg1Hash => holderRoot`. So
anyone who holds the document can:

1. read the chip -> DG1 -> compute `dg1Hash` (BAC needs only the printed MRZ),
2. call `holderOfDocumentHash(dg1Hash)` -> **`holderRoot`**,
3. and `holderRoot` is an INDEXED topic on `DocumentAdded` / `DocumentRegistered` /
   `DocumentRenewed` / `DocumentRevoked` - so one log query yields **how many documents that person
   holds, which types, when each was registered, and every renewal and revocation**.

For the stated threat model that is serious on its own: it tells a border guard, a police officer or
a thief that this person USES THIS PROTOCOL, and multi-citizenship makes it worse - the whole point
of one holder key with several documents is that the set is private, and this publishes its size.

**MAKING THE GETTER PRIVATE WOULD BE THEATRE, and this is the important part.** The obvious fix -
drop `external`, or gate it to the identity registry - **does not work**. The value lives in contract
STORAGE, and any mapping slot is computable and readable with `eth_getStorageAt` by anyone, whatever
Solidity's visibility says. Visibility keeps out casual callers; it does not keep out the adversary
who already has your passport in their hand. **A fix that only removes the getter would look like a
fix and not be one** - exactly the shape this project keeps catching.

**THE REAL FIX IS THE SAME PRIMITIVE AS `propertyKey`, and the tension is structurally identical:**
- anti-replay requires a value **deterministic in the DOCUMENT** - the same passport must not bind
  twice under two holder roots (`test_sameDg1CannotBindToASecondHolderRoot`, and 2.18 records that
  re-homing defeats any identity blacklist by construction);
- privacy requires that value **not be computable by whoever holds the document**.

Deterministic-in-a-bearer-readable-input versus not-enumerable is precisely 2.18ax's problem. So key
the anti-replay on **`OPRF(k, dg1Hash)`** with `k` a threshold key: still deterministic given `k`, so
re-homing stays blocked; not computable by a passport holder without a query that is **oblivious**
(the holders never learn which document) and **rate-limited** (bulk checking of a seized stack of
passports is visible as volume). One primitive, two problems - which is an argument for building it
properly rather than twice.

**DAMAGE-MINIMISATION AVAILABLE WITHOUT THE OPRF**, ranked by whether they actually help:
1. **Stop indexing `holderRoot` on the four document events.** Genuine and cheap: it converts "one
   log query for this person's full history" into "scan and decode every event ever emitted". Does
   not stop a determined adversary, does raise the cost of the casual one, and costs nothing.
2. **Do not return `holderRoot` at all** - have the registry pass `dg1Hash` and receive a boolean, so
   the mapping's VALUE never crosses the ABI. Storage remains readable, so this is a smaller win than
   it looks, but it removes the value from every trace, log and archive-node RPC response.
3. **Recovering the phone changes nothing about this leak** - it is on-chain state, not device state.
   Which is the honest answer to "can they still break it if the phone is recovered": the notes were
   never at risk from the passport, and the registration history was never protected by the phone.

**RECORDED AS A DEFECT, NOT A DESIGN NOTE.** It is not a break of the pool, and it does not touch
funds - but it does defeat the multi-citizenship privacy property that one-key-many-documents exists
to provide, and it is reachable by anyone who handles the document for thirty seconds.

### 2.18bd CAN THE MNEMONIC BE GUESSED? No - and the check found a real bug next to it

*"what if the mnemonic can be guessed? then all crypto wallets in the world are hackable? are you
sure that this security is impenetrable?"* (user, 2026-07-31).

**NO, IT IS NOT IMPENETRABLE, and saying otherwise would be the wrong answer.** Nothing is. But the
mnemonic's brute-force resistance is not the weak link, and the reason is arithmetic rather than
faith: `root.ts` generates `Mnemonic.fromEntropy(hexlify(randomBytes(32)))` - **32 bytes, 256 bits,
24 words**, not the common 12. A 2^256 search is not "expensive", it is beyond any physically
conceivable computation, and even Grover's square-root speed-up leaves 2^128.

**REAL WALLETS ARE NOT BROKEN BY GUESSING SEEDS - THEY ARE BROKEN BY BAD ENTROPY.** Trust Wallet's
2022 browser-extension flaw and the "Milk Sad" libbitcoin bug both generated seeds from a weak or
32-bit-seeded RNG, so the search space collapsed from 2^256 to something enumerable. **That, not
brute force, is the class of bug worth checking for** - so I checked ours.

**THE RESULT IS THE SAFE ONE, and it is structural rather than lucky.** Metro aliases `crypto` to
`crypto-browserify`; its `randombytes/browser.js` reads `global.crypto || global.msCrypto` and, when
`getRandomValues` is absent, exports `oldBrowser` - **a function that THROWS**. It does not fall back
to `Math.random`. So a weak, guessable mnemonic is not a reachable state in this wallet: the failure
mode is "identity creation fails loudly", never "identity created with 32 bits of entropy".

**BUT THE CHECK FOUND A REAL BUG: `polyfills.ts` WAS NEVER IMPORTED.** The file exists and installs
`react-native-get-random-values` and `global.Buffer` - and **nothing referenced it**: not `index.ts`,
not `App.tsx`, not `src/`, not `metro.config.js`, not `babel.config.js`. `index.ts` was three lines
and imported only `expo` and `./App`. So either identity creation throws on first run, or it works
only because the Expo runtime happens to provide `getRandomValues` itself - and which of those is
true cannot be settled without a device build.

**FIXED:**
1. `index.ts` now imports `"./polyfills"` FIRST, with the position documented as load-bearing rather
   than stylistic - an import that must precede all others is exactly the kind that gets dropped.
2. **`react-native-get-random-values` moved from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`.** A RUNTIME
   polyfill in devDependencies survives only because Metro bundles whatever is imported; an
   `npm install --production` would omit it.
3. `root.ts` now asserts `globalThis.crypto?.getRandomValues` before generating, and **names the real
   cause**. The inherited message is *"Secure random number generation is not supported by this
   browser. Use Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer 11"* - accurate for a browser, baffling in a
   mobile wallet, and it names neither the polyfill nor the file that should import it. The guard
   adds no safety; it makes the diagnosis instant.

**WHERE THE ACTUAL RISK LIVES, since "impenetrable" deserves an honest answer:** not in the seed's
length, but in (a) the entropy source - now checked and fail-loud, (b) storage, which is SecureStore
behind biometrics with `WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`, (c) **the user's own backup handling**, which
no code can defend, and (d) the supply chain - ethers, noble, crypto-browserify and the rarime SDK all
run before any of our logic does. (d) is the one nobody in this project has audited.

### 2.18be BLACKLISTING IS PER-IDENTITY, NOT PER-DOCUMENT - and the leak is worse because of it

*"REMEMBER THAT BLACKLISTING IS ON AN IDENTITY, NOT A DOCUMENT... ONE OF YOUR DOCS MIGHT BE GOOD
ANOTHER NOT"* (user, 2026-07-31). Correct, and it sharpens 2.18bc rather than softening it.

**THREE DISTINCT MECHANISMS, and conflating any two produces a wrong design:**

| level | keyed on | what it does | where |
|---|---|---|---|
| **document anti-replay** | `dg1Hash` | one physical passport binds to ONE holderRoot, ever | `_usedDocumentHash`, `_holderOfDocumentHash` |
| **document status** | `documentKey` | one document revoked/renewed/expired, the others unaffected | `revokeDocument`, `renewDocument`, `getActiveDocumentCount` |
| **identity blacklist** | the identity commitment | the PERSON cannot withdraw | `IdentityRegistry`, `withdraw_identity`'s STATUS_CLEAN |

**So one bad document does NOT taint the identity.** `getActiveDocumentCount(holderRoot)` gates on
*any* current document, and the pool proves inclusion at STATUS_CLEAN for a commitment derived from
`sk_identity` - which no document revocation touches. A person with an expired passport and a valid
ID card keeps acting on the ID card. **That is deliberate and must survive any change here** - the
OPRF proposal in 2.18bc changes only the ANTI-REPLAY key and must not be read as moving revocation
to the document level.

**AND IT MAKES THE STOLEN-DOCUMENT LEAK WORSE THAN 2.18bc STATED.** Because blacklisting is
per-identity, learning `holderRoot` from ONE seized document is enough to name the unit the blacklist
acts on - and, via the indexed events, to enumerate every OTHER document under it. So the damage from
holding one document is not "this document is known" but **"this person, and their entire document
set, is identified"**. For a multi-citizenship holder - the exact user this design exists for, someone
whose second passport is the way out - a single border inspection exposes the set. That is the
strongest argument yet for both fixes: the OPRF on the anti-replay key, and de-indexing `holderRoot`.

### 2.18bf ENTROPY HARDENED, AND `holderRoot` DE-INDEXED

*"make sure the entropy source is as bulletproof as conceivable within the laws of physics. leaks
must be impossible. do the deindex"* (user, 2026-07-31). Both done; the honest limits of each are
stated rather than glossed.

**ENTROPY - `src/identity/entropy.ts`, 14 tests.** Seed generation no longer calls one RNG directly:

1. **The CSPRNG is asserted, and its absence names the fix.** The inherited failure was already SAFE
   (crypto-browserify throws rather than falling back to `Math.random` - 2.18bd), but its message
   said *"use Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer 11"* inside a mobile wallet. This adds no safety,
   only an instant diagnosis.
2. **Degenerate output is rejected** - all-zero (an uninitialised buffer), all-0xFF, or any single
   byte repeated (a stuck counter, a stubbed mock). **This is a sanity check, not a randomness test**,
   and the distinction is the point: no test can certify 32 bytes are random, since every specific
   value is equally likely. It catches a source that has plainly STOPPED, and a real CSPRNG hits it
   with probability 256/2^256 - never, in practice.
3. **Multiple sources are mixed through keccak-256, not XOR.** XOR would be adequate but preserves
   position-correlated bias; hashing the concatenation is a randomness EXTRACTOR, so any ONE source
   with full entropy makes the digest unpredictable no matter what the others did. The source COUNT
   and NAMES are hashed in for domain separation - without that, one source returning `a || b` would
   be indistinguishable from two returning `a` and `b`, letting a single compromised source
   impersonate the whole mix.
4. **Every source must succeed.** A throwing source ABORTS generation rather than being skipped -
   silently degrading from two sources to one is exactly how a mixing scheme becomes decorative, and
   the caller cannot tell from the output.

**THE LIMIT, because "bulletproof within the laws of physics" deserves the caveat:** mixing defends
against ONE source failing - a polyfill regression, a platform bug, a bad backport - which is the
realistic case. **It cannot invent entropy if every source is broken the same way.** And nothing here
defends the seed AFTER generation: storage, the user's backup handling, and the supply chain (ethers,
noble, crypto-browserify, the rarime SDK all run before our code) are separate, and the last of those
is unaudited. 256 bits is beyond brute force under any physics we know, including Grover's
square-root speed-up, which leaves 2^128.

**EVERY GUARD IS TESTED BY BREAKING WHAT IT GUARDS** - a stuck source, a predictable source, a
throwing source, a short read, a missing polyfill. A mixing scheme never fed a broken source would
pass identical tests whether or not its checks fired.

**DE-INDEX - five events, `holderRoot` no longer a topic:** `DocumentAdded`, `DocumentRenewed`,
`DocumentRevoked` (`HolderStateKeeper`), `DocumentRegistered`, `DocumentRenewedVia`
(`HolderRegistration`). Verified no consumer filters on it - only emit sites exist - so nothing
breaks; 380 forge tests pass and client ABIs are clean.

**WHAT IT BUYS AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.** It converts "one `eth_getLogs` call returns this person's
entire document set" into "fetch and decode every event this contract ever emitted" - which defeats
casual and bulk lookup at real cost. It does **NOT** defeat an adversary who scrapes the whole log,
and it does **NOT** hide contract STORAGE: `_holderOfDocumentHash` stays readable via
`eth_getStorageAt` whatever Solidity visibility says. **So "leaks must be impossible" is not yet
true**, and no event change can make it true - the complete fix is making the anti-replay key
uncomputable from the document itself (the OPRF, 2.18bc). This is the part available without that
decision, kept rather than dismissed for being partial.

### 2.18bg THE COMPLETE FIX WAS DELETION, NOT AN OPRF - the leak was dead code

*"we shouldnt depend on events. do the complete fix"* (user, 2026-07-31). Right on both counts, and
investigating produced a far better answer than the one I had proposed.

**I HAD THE FIX WRONG.** 2.18bc concluded the complete fix was an OPRF under a threshold key - new
machinery, a liveness dependency, and a quorum this project does not have. Before building that I
checked what `_holderOfDocumentHash` (dg1Hash => holderRoot) is actually FOR. **Nothing calls it.**
The only surviving references were TEST COMMENTS describing what the contract *used to* do:
*"That worked while the contract only checked `holderOfDocumentHash`; since [then] the leaf VALUE
carries the soundness"*. Its own doc comment still explained why it was indispensable - and was
STALE, describing a design that had already moved into the `registrationSmt` leaf.

**SO THE COMPLETE FIX WAS TO DELETE IT.** The mapping, its public getter and both writes are gone.
382 forge tests pass, client ABIs clean. **The worst leak in the identity path was vestigial code
nobody had removed** - which is why the honest move was to check the mechanism before building
cryptography to defend it.

**WHAT A SEIZED DOCUMENT REVEALS NOW.** Only `_usedDocumentHash`, a BOOL, remains keyed on something
a document-holder can compute. So the leak is bounded to **one bit - "this document is registered
here"** - and yields nothing about WHICH identity holds it, how many other documents that identity
holds, or what they are. Given that blacklisting acts on the IDENTITY (2.18be), removing the
identity link removes the ability to name the unit sanctions apply to. That is the difference between
"this person and their entire document set are identified" and "this passport appears in some
system".

**AND EVENTS ARE NO LONGER LOAD-BEARING FOR THIS**, which was the user's actual objection. The
de-indexing in 2.18bf was a mitigation for a leak that no longer exists; it stays because a public
`holderRoot` topic is still worth not publishing, but **nothing about the fix now depends on how logs
are indexed.** Storage was always the real surface - `eth_getStorageAt` ignores Solidity visibility -
and storage is where the fix landed.

**PINNED BY TWO TESTS, ONE OF THEM MUTATION-CHECKED:**
- `test_noPublicFunctionMapsADocumentHashToItsHolder` probes the deployed ABI rather than the source,
  so a future getter under a DIFFERENT NAME would still be caught - a grep would not. **Verified
  non-vacuous:** re-adding a `holderOfDocumentHash` getter makes it fail with its own named message.
- `test_theAntiReplayGuardStillRejectsAReusedDocumentHash` - privacy must not have been bought by
  weakening the guard that stops one physical passport binding to two identities, which is what
  defeats an identity-level blacklist by construction. **Note the trap it avoids:** `documentHash_`
  is the SECOND parameter of `addDocument`, and every existing test passes `bytes32(0)` there, which
  SKIPS the anti-replay path entirely - a test copied from its neighbours would have asserted nothing.

**WHAT REMAINS FOR THE OPRF.** Only the one bit. Removing even that needs the anti-replay key to be
uncomputable from the document, which still means a threshold party. **That is now a much smaller
prize for a much larger cost**, and the decision should be re-taken on those terms rather than the
ones in 2.18bc.

**AUDITED FROM ALL SIDES AFTERWARDS, and the audit found a hazard I had introduced.**

1. **Did deleting it break the security property its comment claimed?** The stale comment warned that
   without the lookup *"a caller could invent a DG1, escrow against it, and land a commitment in the
   identity tree backed by no real document - which would make the tree's scarcity guarantee, and
   therefore the entire blacklist, worthless."* That is a real property, so I verified the
   replacement rather than trusting a test comment: `IdentityRegistry` line 271 requires
   `registrationSmt.isRootValid(registrationRoot_)`, and its own note says the alternative would let
   a prover *"build a tree containing whatever leaf they liked and prove inclusion in that."* The
   escrow circuit proves inclusion of the document leaf; the contract confirms the root came from the
   REAL state keeper, whose only writer is `HolderRegistration`, which does the ICAO check.
   **Property intact.**

2. **STORAGE LAYOUT - THE HAZARD I CREATED.** `HolderStateKeeper` is UUPS-upgradeable and slots are
   assigned by DECLARATION ORDER, so removing a variable from the MIDDLE shifts everything after it.
   `lastDocumentInvalidationAt` was declared immediately after the deleted mapping, and
   `IdentityRegistry` line 277 reads it to enforce `RegistrationRootPredatesAnInvalidation`. **A
   shifted read returns 0, that guard never fires, and a revoked document can escrow against its
   pre-revocation root forever** - the same silent class as sec. 2.18b/e, reintroduced by a change
   made for privacy. No deployment exists in this repo, so a clean deletion would have been safe
   today; a `bytes32 private __deprecated_holderOfDocumentHash` placeholder makes it safe even if an
   instance exists somewhere unrecorded. One unused slot against a silently disabled revocation
   guard is not a close call.

3. **Dangling interface?** None - no `IHolderStateKeeper` or other declaration still exposes the
   removed getter, so no caller can compile against a function that no longer exists.

4. **Does the remaining bool enable more than stated?** Combined with holding the document, it tells
   the holder *"this person uses this protocol"*. That is a real disclosure for this threat model and
   is not eliminated - it is the one bit the OPRF would remove.

5. **Renewal path** still marks `_usedDocumentHash[newDocumentHash_]`, so anti-replay covers renewed
   documents and the deletion did not open a re-binding window there.

### 2.18bh "IS THAT BIT EVEN NECESSARY?" - the bit is, but it was never the main leak. My fix was incomplete.

*"leave no unresolved issues. are you sure that bit is even necessary?"* (user, 2026-07-31). Asking
made me re-derive the surface instead of trusting my own summary, and **the summary was wrong.**

**FIRST, THE BIT ITSELF: YES, NECESSARY.** `_usedDocumentHash` is what stops one physical passport
binding to two holder roots. Since blacklisting acts on the IDENTITY (2.18be), re-binding a seized or
owned passport to a FRESH identity escapes the blacklist entirely - and the attacker can do it,
because they hold the document and can produce a valid registration proof. sec. 2.13b already states
the general form: *"a negative proof is only meaningful against a scarce identity."* The bit is what
makes a document scarce. Removing it does not reduce a leak, it removes the guard.

Bucketing it - the `PRECOMMITMENT_BUCKETS` trick used elsewhere in this repo for exactly this shape of
problem - **does not work here.** Uniqueness checks cannot tolerate collisions: two unrelated
documents sharing a bucket would make the second registration fail as "already used", locking a
legitimate holder out permanently. Confidentiality by collision is fine for DISCOVERY and fatal for
UNIQUENESS.

**BUT THE BIT WAS NEVER THE MAIN LEAK, AND I SAID THE FIX WAS COMPLETE WHEN IT WAS NOT.** Re-deriving
the surface from scratch:

| path | key | passport-derivable? | leaks |
|---|---|---|---|
| `_usedDocumentHash` | `dg1Hash` | **yes** | one bit: registered or not |
| `_documents` | `documentKey` | **YES** - it is `passport.publicKey` / the proof's `passportHash`, both readable from the chip | **`holderRoot`, via `DocumentBond.holderRoot`** |
| `registrationSmt` leaf | `Poseidon(documentKey, holderRoot)` | no - needs `holderRoot` | nothing |
| `_holderDocuments` | `holderRoot` | no - needs `holderRoot` first | nothing (not an entry point) |

**`_documents` IS THE SAME LEAK I JUST CLOSED, THROUGH A SECOND DOOR.** `getDocument(bytes32)` is a
public getter returning `DocumentBond`, whose first field is `holderRoot`. And - exactly as with the
mapping I deleted - **removing the getter would be theatre**, because `_documents[documentKey]` has a
computable slot and `eth_getStorageAt` ignores Solidity visibility. So deleting
`_holderOfDocumentHash` narrowed nothing in practice while I described it as the complete fix.

**WHY I MISSED IT.** I audited the change I MADE rather than the PROPERTY I claimed. Five angles in
2.18bg, all about whether the deletion broke something - none asking "what OTHER document-keyed state
reaches `holderRoot`?" A fix is not verified by checking that it did no harm.

**WHAT AN ACTUAL FIX REQUIRES.** Any mapping from a passport-derivable key to `holderRoot` leaks,
whatever its visibility. So the key must stop being passport-derivable: `_documents` would have to be
keyed on `Poseidon(documentKey, holderRoot)`, so that finding a bond requires already knowing the
holder. That is a real refactor - `revokeDocument`/`renewDocument`/`getDocument` all take
`documentKey` alone today and would need the pair - and it is NOT blocked on the OPRF, unlike the
remaining one bit. **Not attempted here rather than half-done**, because it touches the revocation
path, which is the last thing to change carelessly.

**SO "LEAVE NO UNRESOLVED ISSUES" IS NOT YET TRUE, and saying otherwise would be the more comfortable
lie.** State of the surface: the identity link is still reachable from a seized document via
`_documents`; the one-bit existence leak needs a threshold party; the storage-layout hazard from
2.18bg is closed with a reserved slot; and no event depends on any of it.

### 2.18bi THE BETTER SCARCITY TRICK - store the COMMITMENT, not the value. And the floor beneath it.

*"is there a better scarcity trick? no leaks. no theatre. only complete fixes. investigate
thoroughly"* (user, 2026-07-31). Investigated from the requirement rather than from the code, and the
answer splits cleanly in two: **one half is completely fixable with no new trust; the other is a
genuine floor, not a gap I am avoiding.**

**THE REQUIREMENT PAIR, stated exactly:**
- **R1 SCARCITY** - one physical document yields at most one identity, or an identity-level blacklist
  is evadable by re-registering a document under a fresh identity (sec. 2.13b: *"a negative proof is
  only meaningful against a scarce identity"*).
- **R2 NO DISCLOSURE** - someone holding the document learns nothing on-chain.

**WHY THE OBVIOUS ESCAPES ALL FAIL, checked one at a time:**
- *Include a holder secret in the key* -> a second registrant uses a different secret, produces a
  different key, no collision. **R1 broken.**
- *Bucket the key* (the `PRECOMMITMENT_BUCKETS` trick used elsewhere here) -> two unrelated documents
  share a bucket and the second holder is locked out permanently. **Confidentiality-by-collision is
  right for DISCOVERY and fatal for UNIQUENESS.**
- *Derive from the chip* (Active or Chip Authentication) -> a passport is a BEARER credential; the
  adversary holds it and can run the protocol themselves. **R2 unimproved** (2.18bb).
- *Prove non-membership in-circuit* -> proving "no leaf `Poseidon(documentKey, X)` exists for any
  X != mine" is a non-membership claim over an unbounded set. **Not expressible.**
- *Nullifier, as the pool uses for double-spend* -> a pool nullifier is deterministic in a SECRET;
  this must be deterministic in a PUBLIC document. The analogy breaks exactly there.

**SO R1 FORCES A VALUE DETERMINISTIC IN THE DOCUMENT ALONE, AND ANYONE HOLDING THE DOCUMENT CAN
COMPUTE IT.** That is not a limitation of the implementation; it is the shape of the requirement.

**THE HALF THAT IS COMPLETELY FIXABLE - AND IT IS THE BIG HALF.** What leaks today is not the
existence bit but **`holderRoot` itself**, stored in plaintext under a passport-derivable key
(`_documents[documentKey].holderRoot`, 2.18bh). **Nothing requires storing the VALUE.** Store
`Poseidon(holderRoot)` instead, and the mapping becomes useless to a reader while remaining fully
usable to a caller who already knows the holder:

- `renewDocument` **already takes `holderRoot_`** and merely CHECKS it (line 223,
  `old_.holderRoot == holderRoot_`). Against a stored commitment that becomes
  `Poseidon(holderRoot_) == old_.holderRootCommitment` - identical cost, identical guarantee.
- `revokeDocument(documentKey_)` is the **only** site that genuinely READS the value (lines 264, 271,
  for the SMT index and the event). It takes `holderRoot_` as a parameter and verifies the
  commitment - and its caller, `HolderRegistration`, knows the holder already.
- `registrationSmt` is unaffected: its index is already `Poseidon(documentKey, holderRoot)`, which a
  document-holder cannot compute.
- `_holderDocuments` is keyed BY `holderRoot`, so it is not an entry point - you need the answer
  before you can ask.

`holderRoot` is a high-entropy field element derived from a public key, so `Poseidon(holderRoot)` is
not dictionary-attackable. **This is a complete fix for the identity link, with no new trust, no new
party, and no theatre** - unlike removing a getter, it defeats `eth_getStorageAt` too, because the
value simply is not there.

**THE FLOOR: ONE BIT, AND IT IS IRREDUCIBLE WITHOUT A THRESHOLD PARTY.** After that change a
document-holder can still learn *"this document is registered here"* - because R1 requires a
publicly-checkable, document-deterministic value, and any such value can be checked by whoever holds
the document. Removing even that requires the value to be computable ONLY with a key nobody holds
alone: an OPRF under a threshold key, which is precisely 2.18ax's conclusion arrived at from the
other direction. **That is a floor imposed by the requirement, not an omission.** It is worth being
exact about what it discloses: not who you are, not how many documents you hold, not which - only
that this one document appears in this system.

**IMPLEMENTED (2026-07-31). `holderRoot` IS NO LONGER STORED IN PLAINTEXT ANYWHERE.**

- `DocumentBond.holderRoot` -> `holderRootCommitment`, holding `Poseidon(holderRoot)`.
- `renewDocument` compares the commitment instead of the value - identical cost, identical guarantee,
  since it already took `holderRoot_` and only ever CHECKED it.
- `revokeDocument(documentKey_)` -> `revokeDocument(documentKey_, holderRoot_)`, verifying the
  commitment before using the value for the SMT index and the event.
- `revokeDocumentViaSigner` gained the same parameter. **Deliberately NOT added to the signed data**:
  the keeper checks it against the commitment, so a wrong holder reverts and the parameter cannot be
  used to revoke someone else's document. What authorises the revocation is still the signature over
  the PASSPORT, unchanged - so the backend's signing format does not move.
- `_holderCommitment` is ONE definition used by bind, renew and revoke, so the three cannot drift -
  the lesson of 2.18o, where one rule written three times carried the same defect in all three.

**384 forge tests, ABIs clean.** Two new tests, written to fail against the OLD code rather than
merely pass against the new: `test_aSeizedDocumentDoesNotRevealItsHoldersIdentity` asserts the stored
value is NOT the holder root AND IS the commitment; `test_revokingWithTheWrongHolderIsRejected` proves
the commitment is BINDING rather than decorative - without it, passing the identity as a parameter
would be an unchecked assertion by the caller.

**WHAT THIS CLOSES.** A seized document yields `documentKey`, and `_documents[documentKey]` is
readable from storage whatever the getter says - but the identity is no longer in it. So the holder
learns nothing about WHO, nothing about how many other documents that identity holds, and nothing
about which. That was the leak that mattered, and it is closed by absence rather than by access
control.

### 2.18bj THE OPRF CANNOT RIDE ON CRE - and it does not need to. Checked before building.

2.18ax flagged one thing as reasoned-but-unverified: *"whether a threshold OPRF composes with CRE's
consensus model (every node must produce byte-identical output - an OPRF evaluation is deterministic
given `k`, so it plausibly does, but 'plausibly' is not 'checked')."* Checked. **It does not, and the
reason reframes the whole build.**

**THE CRE SDK OFFERS EXACTLY FIVE AGGREGATORS** (`cre-sdk-go@v1.15.0/cre/consensus_aggregators.go`):
`ConsensusMedianAggregation` (numeric median), `ConsensusIdenticalAggregation` (all nodes identical),
`ConsensusCommonPrefixAggregation`, `ConsensusCommonSuffixAggregation`, and
`ConsensusAggregationFromTags` (per-field, composed from the others).

**A THRESHOLD OPRF PRODUCES INTENTIONALLY DIVERGENT OUTPUTS, so every one of them fails.** Each node
applies its own KEY SHARE to the blinded input, so the partial evaluations DIFFER BY DESIGN - that
divergence is the mechanism, not a fault. `Identical` rejects it outright; `Median` is meaningless
over group elements; prefix/suffix have nothing in common to find. **My guess in 2.18ax was wrong in
a specific and instructive way: I reasoned about the OPRF's OUTPUT being deterministic given `k`, and
forgot that in a THRESHOLD scheme no node ever computes that output** - the client does, by combining
partials.

**BUT THE PREMISE WAS WRONG TOO, WHICH IS THE USEFUL PART: A THRESHOLD OPRF DOES NOT WANT CONSENSUS.**
The protocol is client-driven - blind the input, send it to `n` nodes, collect `t` partials, combine
by Lagrange interpolation, unblind. There is no point at which the nodes need to agree with each
other, and forcing them through a consensus layer would break the scheme rather than secure it. So
the OPRF is **not** a CRE workflow and is **not blocked on CRE at all**.

**WHAT THAT CHANGES ABOUT THE PLAN:**
- The DON that anchors the notary registry is **not** automatically the OPRF quorum. Two separate
  trust structures, and 2.18ax's "hold `k` across the DON that already anchors the notary register"
  was a convenience that does not survive contact with how either actually works.
- It needs its own deployment and its own distributed key generation - **new operational trust and a
  new liveness dependency**, not a reuse of existing infrastructure.
- Use a **VERIFIABLE** OPRF (VOPRF): each node proves in zero knowledge that its partial was computed
  with the committed share. Without that, a malicious node corrupts the result silently and the
  client cannot tell. With it, a bad node can only REFUSE - which is the censorship property
  2.13b cares about, and it degrades to "t honest nodes are reachable" rather than "all nodes
  behave".

**SO THE COST IS HIGHER THAN 2.18ax ESTIMATED AND THE PRIZE IS STILL ONE BIT** (2.18bi closed the
identity leak; what remains is only *"this document is registered here"*). That is now an explicit
trade: standing up a VOPRF quorum with its own DKG, availability and operational trust, to remove one
bit of disclosure. **Recorded so the decision is taken on real numbers** rather than on the
comfortable assumption that existing infrastructure would carry it.

### 2.18bk THE OPRF IS NOT A CIRCUIT - and the scalar-inverse trap that would have broken it silently

Started implementing and stopped at the first real question: **where does this code run?** Two
findings, both of which would have cost a rebuild if discovered later.

**1. NO CIRCUIT IS INVOLVED. AT ALL.** A 2HashDH VOPRF has three roles and none of them is a prover:
- **client (wallet)** blinds `B = r * H(x)`, then unblinds `U = r^-1 * E`
- **each quorum node** evaluates `E_i = k_i * B` with its key share
- **the contract** merely STORES the resulting value as the anti-replay key

The circuits never see it. I had drifted toward `pp/src/` because that is where `mul_point` lives, and
that is the wrong home: **the OPRF belongs in the wallet (TypeScript) and in a node service**, with
Solidity only as a consumer. Building it in Noir would have produced a correct primitive in a place
nothing can call from.

**2. THE SCALAR-INVERSE TRAP, which is the reason this is worth writing down.** Unblinding needs
`r^-1` **modulo the CURVE SUBGROUP ORDER `l`**, not modulo the field. Noir's `Field` is BN254's
scalar field `Fr`, and BabyJubjub's subgroup order `l` is a DIFFERENT, smaller modulus. So a natural
`r.inverse()` in Noir computes the inverse in the wrong group and yields `U != k*H(x)`.

**AND THE FAILURE WOULD BE SILENT IN THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY.** A wrong unblinding still returns a
well-formed curve point. Registration would succeed, the value would look fine - and it would DIFFER
per blinding factor `r`, so the same document would produce a different key on every registration.
**That destroys exactly the property the OPRF exists to provide**: determinism in the document, which
is what makes a document scarce (2.18bi). The anti-replay guard would silently stop working, and
nothing would report it - one physical passport could bind to unlimited identities, which is the
blacklist evasion of 2.13b restored in full.

**SO THE IMPLEMENTATION IS TYPESCRIPT, AND THE DEPENDENCY IS ALREADY PRESENT.** `@noble/curves` is a
wallet dependency today and provides curve groups with correct scalar arithmetic. **RFC 9497** is the
OPRF standard and specifies exactly this construction with ristretto255 or P-256 - use it rather than
hand-rolling over BabyJubjub, since the only reason to prefer BabyJubjub is in-circuit friendliness,
and there is no circuit.

**WHAT REMAINS TO BUILD, in order:** (a) the client blind/unblind and node evaluate over
`@noble/curves`, with RFC 9497's own test vectors - pure, testable, no infrastructure; (b) the
zero-knowledge proof of correct evaluation that makes it VERIFIABLE, so a bad node can only refuse
rather than corrupt (2.18bj); (c) distributed key generation and the quorum deployment, which is
operational rather than cryptographic; (d) migrate `_usedDocumentHash`'s key to the OPRF output.
**Only (d) touches this repo's contracts**, and it is one line once (a)-(c) exist.

### 2.18bl DO THE CHAINLINK NODES LEAK? And should a TEE hold `k` instead? No - and the reason is decisive.

**WHAT THE CRE NODES SEE TODAY: ONLY PUBLIC DATA.** `notary_registry` fetches a GOVERNMENT REGISTER
that is public by construction - sec. 2.15a's whole design depends on it being public, since that is
what makes independent verification possible - and publishes a Merkle root plus leaves. **There is no
user data in the workflow at all**, so today's answer is not "mitigated", it is "nothing to leak".

**IF AN OPRF RAN ON THEM, THE CONTENT WOULD STILL BE SAFE, BY CONSTRUCTION.** A node sees `r * H(x)`
for a uniformly random blinding factor `r`. That is a uniformly random group element to them -
learning the document from it is the discrete-log problem. **Blinding is not a mitigation bolted on;
it is the mechanism.**

**THE REAL RESIDUAL IS METADATA, and it should be named rather than waved at.** Nodes would see WHO
queries (network origin), WHEN, and HOW OFTEN. No cryptography removes that. Two things bound it:
- **The OPRF query happens ONCE PER DOCUMENT AT REGISTRATION, never per withdrawal.** So the exposure
  is a single query per document lifetime, not a running signal - which is a categorically smaller
  surface than a per-action oracle.
- Anything that decouples network identity from the query (Tor, a relay, batching) reduces it
  further, and none of it is novel work.

**SHOULD A SWITCHBOARD-STYLE TEE HOLD `k` INSTEAD? NO, AND ONE PROPERTY DECIDES IT.**
`k` **MUST NEVER ROTATE** (2.18ax): uniqueness has to hold across decades, so a rotated key silently
un-collides old documents against new ones. **A key that can never rotate must not live anywhere whose
compromise is RETROACTIVE AND TOTAL.**

That is exactly what a TEE break is. SGX has been broken repeatedly and publicly - Foreshadow,
Plundervolt, SGAxe, AEPIC, Downfall - and such breaks are typically discovered YEARS after the
hardware shipped. If `k` leaks even once, every document ever registered becomes enumerable
retroactively AND forever, because the key cannot be rotated away from the compromise. **A threshold
scheme has no equivalent failure**: an attacker must break `t` independent holders simultaneously, and
a single compromised share reveals nothing.

**AND IT WOULD REINTRODUCE A REJECTED DEPENDENCY.** SGX attestation roots to Intel; SEV to AMD. That
is a US hardware vendor in the trust path for users whose threat model is a hostile state - the same
objection sec. 2.22c raised against recovery SDKs that gate on Google or Apple. (Note this repo's
sibling SPV tree DOES already carry Intel SGX attestation material for the Lightning side, so the
technology is not unfamiliar here - but that path secures a different property, and its trust root
was acceptable there in a way it is not for a non-rotatable global key.)

**WHERE A TEE WOULD GENUINELY BE BETTER:** anything short-lived, rotatable, or where the alternative
is trusting one operator outright. Neither describes `k`.

**IF ONE IS USED ANYWAY, the only defensible form is threshold-OF-enclaves** - each share inside a
separate enclave, ideally on mixed vendors - which is defence in depth rather than a substitute, and
inherits both sets of complexity. Do not read "we could use a TEE" as "we could skip the DKG".

### 2.18bm ENROLMENT NAMES THE NOTARY - the leak I traded away without noticing

*"the fact that we searched a particular identity to confirm that they are a notary is a leak that
they are a provider on our platform"* (user, 2026-07-31). **Correct, and 2.18am called that trade
deliberate when it should have called it a gap.**

**WHAT IS ACTUALLY SOLVED - action time.** `notary_action` proves membership in the notary tree in
zero knowledge, and ANY active notary may endorse (no minting-notary binding, 2.18am). So a title
records THAT an active notary acted and never WHICH, and because there is no per-notary pseudonym,
nothing links the titles one notary touched. **"Who they provide for" does not leak** - not per title,
not across titles.

**WHAT IS NOT SOLVED - enrolment.** `registerNotary(notaryCommitment, notaryDataHash, registryId,
registryProof)` puts **`notaryDataHash` in calldata**, and that hash is
`keccak(regNumber, fullName, region, status)` over a register that is **public by construction**
(2.18ao). So anyone can compute it for every notary in the country and match: **enrolment publicly
names who joined the platform.**

**AND THAT IS THE MORE DANGEROUS FACT, which is why I got the trade backwards.** The threat this
design exists for is notaries being punished for serving the system - and a prosecutor does not need
to know which notary signed which title. **A list of everyone enrolled is the whole target set**, and
it is exactly what enrolment publishes. Protecting action-time while publishing the roster protects
the wrong thing: I wrote *"registration stays public and verified, deliberately"* in 2.18am, reasoning
that it kept the postman from inventing notaries. That reasoning was sound and the conclusion was
still wrong, because it never asked what the disclosure COSTS.

**THE FIX IS THE PATTERN ALREADY BUILT, MOVED ONE STEP EARLIER.** Registration should carry a ZK proof
of *"this commitment belongs to SOME member of the active-notary snapshot"* rather than the leaf
itself - the identical anonymous-set-membership shape as `notary_action`, applied at admission. Then
enrolment reveals only that the set grew by one.

Two consequences worth stating:
- **The anonymity set is the whole register**, which is far larger than the enrolled set - so this is
  strictly stronger than hiding among fellow users of the platform.
- **THE POSTMAN CANNOT BE REMOVED - I was wrong to say so, and it matters before anyone builds this.**
  A register entry is `(regNumber, fullName, region, status)`: **public data with no key attached.**
  So a ZK proof of *"some leaf is in the active root"* can be produced by ANYONE holding any leaf and
  path - which is everyone, since the register is public - and they would bind THEIR OWN commitment
  to it. Self-enrolment would let a stranger become a notary.

  Binding a commitment to a SPECIFIC register entry needs a link between that entry and something only
  that person holds, and **no such link exists**: it is precisely the OPEN GAP the contract header
  already names (*"binding a real-world notary's identity to an on-chain signing address... needs an
  out-of-band process that isn't built yet"*). The postman gate exists because of that gap, not by
  oversight, and this change does not close it.

  **What the fix DOES achieve is still the important half:** the postman submits a PROOF instead of
  the leaf, so the chain - and everyone reading it - learns that the set grew by one and nothing more.
  The postman still knows who; **the public no longer does.** Trust is unchanged, disclosure is
  removed, and the 2.13b inaction objection against the postman gate stands exactly as before.

**THE ONE REAL COST: the CRE snapshot is a KECCAK tree** (2.18ao chose keccak deliberately, as
`MerkleProof.verify` compatible and not then ZK-consumed). Proving keccak-Merkle inclusion in Noir is
expensive - roughly one keccak per level. Either accept that cost, or mirror the snapshot into a
Poseidon SMT and prove against that, which is cheap in-circuit and adds a mirroring step whose
correctness is publicly checkable against the keccak root. **The second is almost certainly right**,
and it is the same shape as the identity registry.

**NOT BUILT.** It needs a circuit, a contract change to `registerNotary`, and the mirror. Recorded now
because the current design would otherwise ship having published the list it exists to protect.

### 2.18bn THE POSTMAN IS A REAL VULNERABILITY - three levers, and anonymity REMOVES the audit trail

*"can the postman be corrupted? is it a vulnerability? is it better to do task 16 after we finish the
aggregation?"* (user, 2026-07-31). Yes, yes, and yes - with one interaction that must be designed for
rather than discovered.

**THREE LEVERS A CORRUPT POSTMAN HAS TODAY:**
1. **IMPERSONATION.** `registerNotary` proves the register ENTRY is real; it does NOT prove the
   commitment belongs to that person. So a postman can admit a commitment THEY control against any
   genuine notary's entry and act as that notary indefinitely. This is the OPEN GAP the contract
   header already names - the identity<->register binding - seen from the attacker's side.
2. **REFUSAL.** Declining to enrol censors by inaction, indistinguishably from being slow: sec. 2.13b's
   objection, still live.
3. **ARBITRARY REVOCATION.** `revokeNotary(commitment, predicate)` is postman-gated and requires **no
   proof of anything** - not a fault, not a register change. A corrupt postman can silence any notary
   at will. **This one is NOT recorded anywhere else and is the most immediately usable**, because
   unlike impersonation it needs no setup.

**THE INTERACTION THAT MATTERS FOR TASK #16: ANONYMOUS ENROLMENT DESTROYS THE ONLY AUDIT TRAIL ON
LEVER 1.** Today `notaryDataHash` is in calldata, so a notary - or anyone - can in principle notice
that their register entry was enrolled without their knowledge. **After #16 nobody can**, because the
chain no longer records which entry was used. Privacy at enrolment and accountability of the enroller
are in direct tension here, and #16 as specified silently trades the second away.

**SO #16 NEEDS A DETECTION PATH BUILT WITH IT, not after.** The cheapest form: the notary can check
their OWN enrolment - given their commitment they can verify it is in the tree, and given their
register entry they can confirm no OTHER commitment claims it. That requires the postman to publish
something the entry's true holder can check but a third party cannot correlate - a deterministic
per-entry tag under a key only the notary and postman share, for instance. **Not designed yet.**
Recording it as a REQUIREMENT of #16 rather than a follow-up, because building #16 without it
converts a detectable attack into an undetectable one.

**ORDERING: AGGREGATION FIRST. #16 BEFORE THE FIRST REAL NOTARY ENROLS.**

The right criterion is irreversibility, not importance:
- **Nothing is deployed and no notary has enrolled**, so the enrolment disclosure is accruing NO harm
  today. It becomes irreversible the moment a real notary enrols - those names are on-chain forever
  and cannot be un-published.
- **The aggregator is on the money path**: ~200k gas per withdrawal today versus ~68k at N=16, which
  is the difference between a pool usable for ordinary amounts and one that is not. It blocks real
  users now.
- Aggregation is fully specified and unblocked; #16 still needs a mirror, a circuit, a contract change
  **and now a detection mechanism that does not exist**.

**So: aggregation first - but #16 is a HARD GATE on notary enrolment, not a nice-to-have.** If
enrolment ships before it, the disclosure is permanent for everyone who enrolled in the interim.

### 2.18bo WHERE THE POSTMAN CAME FROM, AND HOW TO REMOVE IT - name-binding, using circuits we already have

*"where did postman come up in the first place? why is it necessary? is there a better solution that
cant be a single point of failure or leakage?"* (user, 2026-07-31).

**ORIGIN: IT WAS NEVER DESIGNED FOR THIS.** `REGISTRY_POSTMAN` is `RegistrySourceAnchor`'s role for
submitting CRE snapshots - the DON's write path. `TitleLedger` REUSED it for notary binding, and its
own comment says why: *"gated by NOTARY_REGISTRY's own REGISTRY_POSTMAN role... deliberately the SAME
trust boundary the notary registry itself already rests on, not an additional,
independently-scrutinized authority."* The intent was **one trust assumption instead of two**, which
was right - but it quietly gave a snapshot-submission role the power to decide **who is a notary**.
Those are different powers wearing one hat.

**WHY IT IS THERE: the identity<->register binding gap.** A register entry is public data with no key
(2.18bm), so SOMEONE must assert "this commitment is that person". The postman is that someone.

**THE THREE LEVERS HAVE THREE DIFFERENT FIXES, and one needs no new trust at all:**

**1. ARBITRARY REVOCATION - fixable NOW, no new party.** `revokeNotary(commitment, predicate)`
requires no proof of any fault. It should require EVIDENCE: a proof that the register no longer lists
that entry as active, checked against the CRE-anchored root the contract already trusts. Then
revocation follows the register rather than an operator's discretion, and the lever disappears. **This
is the cheapest and most immediately usable of the three, and it is pure contract work.**

**2. IMPERSONATION - removable with circuits ALREADY BUILT.** A register entry carries `fullName` and
`region`. `query_identity` already proves selective disclosure over a registered document's MRZ,
including the name field. So a notary can prove, in zero knowledge:
  (i) they hold a CURRENT registered document (the permissionless, ICAO-verified path);
  (ii) its name field matches the `fullName` of register entry E;
  (iii) E is in the active-notary root.
and bind their own commitment. **No postman asserts anything** - the claim is cryptographic, and the
attacker now needs a genuine passport whose name matches the target notary's, which is an enormously
higher bar than compromising an admin key.

*Honest weakness:* names are not unique. Adding `region` narrows it; it does not close it. **But the
comparison is not against perfection, it is against "one role key can impersonate any notary in the
country."** Combining with the postman as a SECOND factor - both a proof and the gate - is strictly
better than either alone and needs no new machinery.

**3. REFUSAL - dissolves once 2 lands.** If enrolment is self-service and cryptographic, there is
nobody to decline.

**AND THIS SETTLES THE INTERACTION 2.18bn FLAGGED.** The audit-trail problem existed because an
anonymous enrolment hides POSTMAN impersonation. **With name-binding there is no postman to
impersonate** - a false enrolment requires a passport matching the victim's name, not an admin key -
so anonymity no longer trades away accountability. The detection mechanism 2.18bn demanded as a
prerequisite for #16 is **not needed if #16 is built on name-binding instead of on a postman
assertion.** That is a strictly better design AND a simpler one, which is usually the sign of being
right.

**REVISED ORDER FOR TASK #16:** (a) evidence-bound revocation - small, no new trust, do it first;
(b) name-binding enrolment circuit, reusing `query_identity`'s disclosure machinery; (c) the Poseidon
mirror and anonymous enrolment on top, which is now safe because there is no unaudited assertion left
to hide.

### 2.18bp THE DEEPER POSTMAN DEPENDENCY - it controls the REGISTER, so name-binding relocates the power rather than removing it

*"are you sure there isnt a deeper fix with our postman dependency across the rest of the scope it
touches?"* (user, 2026-07-31). There is, and **it invalidates the claim I made one section ago.**

**I ANALYSED THE POSTMAN ONLY THROUGH `TitleLedger`.** Enumerating the whole surface shows its real
power is upstream: `RegistrySourceAnchor.publishSnapshot(registryId_, leaves_)` and `onReport` are
both `onlyRole(REGISTRY_POSTMAN)`, and **they decide WHAT THE REGISTER SAYS.**

**THE CONTRACT VERIFIES ROOT-AGAINST-LEAVES, NOT LEAVES-AGAINST-REALITY.** `_computeRoot` derives the
root from the submitted leaves, so a published root always corresponds to a real, available leaf set -
the property the header claims, and it is true. **But nothing checks those leaves are the government
register.** A corrupt postman can publish a snapshot containing invented notaries, or omitting real
ones. sec. 2.18ao already said consensus makes every node agree but *"cannot make them agree
CORRECTLY"* - and I did not carry that forward to the contract's trust model.

**SO 2.18bo IS WRONG WHERE IT MATTERS.** I claimed name-binding removes the postman, because an
attacker would need a passport matching the target notary's name. **They would not: the postman can
insert a register entry bearing the ATTACKER'S name**, after which the attacker self-enrols entirely
legitimately, with a valid ZK proof, against a root the contract trusts. Name-binding moves the
postman from *"who is a notary"* to *"what the register says"* - **and the second still determines the
first.** The fix is real but it is a narrowing, not a removal, and I should not have called it a
removal.

**THE DEEPER FIX, AND THE MECHANISM IS ALREADY HALF-BUILT.** `ROOT_ACTIVATION_DELAY` is one hour -
**a challenge window with no challenger.** Two additions, neither of which needs a new trusted party:

1. **m-of-n PUBLICATION.** Require k independent submitters to agree on a snapshot before it can
   activate - different operators, ideally different jurisdictions. One key becomes a quorum. This is
   the same argument that decided against a TEE for the OPRF key (2.18bl): a single holder whose
   compromise is total and undetectable is the thing to eliminate, not to guard.
2. **A CHALLENGE BOUND TO THE EXISTING DELAY.** The register is PUBLIC, so anyone can compare the
   published leaves against it. Let any party halt activation by pointing at a leaf that is not in the
   register, or a register entry the snapshot omits. **The verifier is a human reading a public
   register**, which is exactly the audience this design already assumes - and it uses the hour that
   is already there and currently does nothing.

**WHY THIS ORDERING MATTERS FOR #16.** Anonymous enrolment (#16) hides which entry was used, so it
also hides a fabricated entry being used. **Publishing integrity must be fixed BEFORE enrolment
anonymity**, or #16 converts a detectable forgery into an undetectable one - the same trap 2.18bn
identified, one layer up, and one I would have walked into again having just declared it settled.

**REVISED ORDER, replacing 2.18bo's:** (a) evidence-bound revocation; (b) m-of-n publication and the
challenge window; (c) name-binding enrolment; (d) anonymity on top. Only after (b) does (d) stop
hiding the thing that matters.

**AND (a) IS NOT THE CHEAP ITEM I CALLED IT - checked before starting.** I described evidence-bound
revocation as *"small, no new trust, pure contract work"*. **It is not implementable against the
current snapshot format at all.** `activeLeaves` publishes leaves ONLY for active notaries
(`case meaningActive`), so a terminated notary is simply **ABSENT** from the tree - and absence cannot
be proven with a keccak `MerkleProof`, which shows membership and nothing else. Non-membership needs a
sorted tree with neighbour proofs, or an SMT.

**So the evidence a revocation would cite does not exist on-chain.** Making it exist means changing
what the scraper publishes: the FULL register with `status` as a leaf field rather than an
active-only filter, so "this entry is terminated" becomes a positive membership claim. That is a Go
change, a contract change, new fixtures, and a re-think of the cross-language check in
`NotaryRegistryProof.t.sol` - **not one contract edit.**

It also interacts with (b): if the snapshot carries every entry rather than the active subset, the
challenge window's comparison becomes simpler and stronger, because a challenger checks the whole
register rather than a filtered view they cannot independently reconstruct. **These two should be
designed together**, which is another reason (a) is not a quick win to land first.

### 2.18bq THE POSTMAN CANNOT BE REMOVED WHILE CRE REPLACES TLSNotary - the trade 2.15a made, seen properly

Four objections, all correct, and the fourth reaches further than the refactor they were about.

**1. "how can k independent submitters agree if they might not have information outside their
jurisdiction?"** They cannot, and my *"ideally across jurisdictions"* was hand-waving. A submitter in
Warsaw verifies Ukraine's register no better than anyone else - **they fetch the same URL.** What
m-of-n actually buys is that one corrupt operator cannot unilaterally publish a fabricated set,
because the others fetched the real thing and would produce a different root. **That is independence
of FETCH, not of KNOWLEDGE**, and jurisdiction diversity buys coercion-resistance, not accuracy. Worth
having; not what I implied.

**2. "using an hour that does nothing isn't ideal - no component should be doing nothing."** Right.
`ROOT_ACTIVATION_DELAY` today delays and nothing more: it creates a window in which a bad snapshot
COULD be noticed, with no mechanism to act on noticing. **That is half a feature**, and the standing
rule applies - either it does work or it should not exist. Wire the challenge to it, or delete it.

**3. "you can't publish the full register if you don't know all the names in advance?"** The bulk
export DOES give every entry, so publishing all of them with `status` as a leaf field is possible.
**But completeness is unprovable**: no one reading a snapshot can tell whether entries were OMITTED.
That is precisely why full-register-with-status is the right change - it converts revocation from an
ABSENCE claim (unprovable, and defeated by an incomplete scrape) into a PRESENCE claim (*"this entry
says terminated"*), which survives incompleteness. The objection strengthens the fix rather than
blocking it.

**4. "don't relocate rather than remove the postman." THE DEEPEST FINDING, and it is about 2.15a.**

The spec originally specified **TLSNotary** over the register. 2.15a replaced it with CRE, arguing *"we
already have the property that buys, by a cheaper route"* because consensus requires every DON node to
fetch independently and agree byte-for-byte.

**Those are not the same property, and the difference is exactly the postman.**
- **TLSNotary proves THE DATA CAME FROM THE REGISTER** - a cryptographic transcript of the TLS session
  with the government's own server, bound to its certificate. No publisher is trusted, because the
  proof is about the SOURCE.
- **CRE proves ONLY THAT THE NODES AGREE.** 2.18ao already recorded that consensus *"cannot make them
  agree CORRECTLY"* - and the corollary was never drawn: with nothing tying the report to the
  register, **someone must be trusted to have fetched honestly. That someone is the postman.**

**So the postman is not an implementation wart. It is the exact cost of the 2.15a trade**, and no
amount of m-of-n, name-binding or challenge windows removes it - each only narrows who must be
trusted or raises the odds of noticing. **The only construction that REMOVES it is one that proves
provenance**: TLSNotary, or a register that publishes signed data, or any scheme where the
government's own key underwrites the bytes.

**WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE ORDER OF WORK.** Building m-of-n, the challenge window and anonymous
enrolment on the current foundation is not wrong, but it is **defence in depth around a trusted
publisher**, and should be described that way rather than as removing one. **The decision to re-take
is 2.15a itself**: whether TLSNotary's cost is worth the property CRE cannot provide. That is a
genuine trade with real numbers on both sides - MPC-TLS is expensive and brittle against portal
changes, which is why it was dropped - but it should be re-taken knowing that what was given up was
*the removal of the trusted publisher*, not merely some machinery.

### 2.18br CRE AND TLS PROVENANCE ARE COMPLEMENTARY - and together they REMOVE the postman

*"are you telling me with TLSnotary we dont need CRE? we would still need it regardless"* (user,
2026-07-31). **Correct, and I posed them as alternatives when they solve different problems.** 2.15a
made the same error in the other direction - it swapped one for the other as though they were
substitutes.

**THEY ANSWER DIFFERENT QUESTIONS:**
- **TLS provenance answers "is this data really from the register?"** - a proof bound to the
  government server's certificate. It says nothing about scheduling, redundancy, or getting on-chain.
- **CRE answers "who runs the fetch, on what schedule, with what redundancy, and how does the result
  reach the contract?"** It says nothing about whether the bytes are authentic - 2.18ao already
  established consensus cannot make nodes agree CORRECTLY.

**Neither replaces the other. Dropping TLSNotary did not remove a redundant layer; it removed the
only layer that spoke to authenticity, leaving the postman to stand in for it.**

**THE SYNTHESIS: CRE NODES PRODUCE THE PROVENANCE PROOF AS PART OF THE FETCH, AND THE CONTRACT
VERIFIES IT.** Then:
- CRE keeps everything it is good at - cron, independent fetches, aggregation, report delivery.
- The contract checks the TLS proof instead of trusting the report's provenance.
- **The postman collapses into a RELAY.** It still submits the transaction, still pays gas, still
  chooses WHEN - but it **cannot fabricate an entry or omit one undetectably**, because a snapshot
  without a valid proof is rejected outright. That is removal of the POWER, which is what was asked,
  rather than relocation of it.

**AND IT SETTLES THE CHALLENGE-WINDOW QUESTION** - *"wire the challenge if it's necessary?"* **It
becomes unnecessary.** A challenge window is a DETECTION mechanism for forgeries that are possible; if
the contract verifies provenance, forgery is IMPOSSIBLE rather than merely noticeable. **Prevention
beats detection**, and it also discharges the standing rule the user restated - `ROOT_ACTIVATION_DELAY`
stops being an hour that does nothing, because it can simply be **deleted** rather than given a job.
That is the better resolution of "no component should do nothing": remove the component, not invent
work for it.

**WHAT REMAINS TRUSTED, stated so this is not overclaimed:** the register itself (if the government
publishes false data, a proof of provenance faithfully proves false data - no cryptography fixes
that), and LIVENESS (a relay that submits nothing publishes nothing, which is 2.13b's inaction
objection surviving in its weakest form - anyone can relay, so it is competitive rather than
exclusive).

**IMPLEMENTATION NOTE, because "TLSNotary" names the expensive option specifically.** Classic
TLSNotary is MPC-TLS - expensive and brittle, which is why 2.15a dropped it. The property needed is
narrower: a succinct, on-chain-verifiable proof that bytes came from a named TLS server. Modern
zkTLS/web-proof constructions target exactly that and produce proofs cheap enough to verify on-chain.
**The question to answer before building is which construction verifies within our gas budget**, not
whether to have provenance at all - that question is now settled.

**THIS SUPERSEDES THE ORDER IN 2.18bp.** m-of-n publication and the challenge window were
compensating for the missing provenance layer. With provenance verified on-chain they are
unnecessary, and the remaining work is: (a) provenance verification in `RegistrySourceAnchor`;
(b) full-register-with-status so revocation is a presence claim; (c) name-binding enrolment;
(d) anonymity. **(a) makes (b)-(d) safe rather than merely deeper.**

### 2.18bs VERIFY TLS INSIDE THE WORKFLOW - gas stops being the constraint, and workflow pinning becomes everything

*"idk if gas budget is even an issue if the actual tls runs as part of the cre. we just need to make
sure we have a way of pinning the cre code being executed by the don nodes."* (user, 2026-07-31).
**That is the right architecture and it dissolves the question I was about to research.**

**GAS WAS THE WRONG CONSTRAINT.** If each DON node verifies the TLS proof DURING its fetch, the
contract never sees the proof - it sees a consensus report over an ALREADY-VERIFIED result. So
"which zkTLS construction verifies within our gas budget" is moot; the real constraint is **"which
verifier compiles to `wasip1` and runs inside the CRE sandbox"**, which is a different and much
easier question. `notary_registry` is already `//go:build wasip1`, so the shape is known.

**AND IT MAKES CONSENSUS MEAN SOMETHING IT DOES NOT MEAN TODAY.** 2.18ao's objection was that
`ConsensusIdenticalAggregation` proves nodes AGREE, never that they are RIGHT. With in-workflow
verification, agreement is over *"the register's own TLS server served these bytes"* - **so the thing
they agree on is now anchored to the source.** That is the property 2.18bq said only provenance could
provide, obtained without a single on-chain verification.

**WHICH MOVES THE ENTIRE TRUST QUESTION ONTO WORKFLOW PINNING - and 2.15a already saw this.** It
states plainly: ***"CRE's consensus protects against a rogue NODE, not against a rogue WORKFLOW"***,
and lists the mitigations: a deterministic wasm ID so a pointer names a SPECIFIC auditable artifact;
APPEND-ONLY version history so a swap is permanently visible; a TIMELOCK so a swap can be contested
before it is load-bearing; and fail-open to the last good version.

**SO THE POSTMAN DOES NOT VANISH - IT BECOMES THE WORKFLOW PUBLISHER, AND THAT IS A GENUINELY WEAKER
POWER.** Be exact about the difference, because this is the whole argument:
- **Today** the postman can publish FABRICATED DATA silently. Nothing in the artifact reveals it; you
  would have to compare against the register yourself.
- **After** they can only publish a DIFFERENT WORKFLOW - a specific, hash-identified, publicly
  auditable, append-only-recorded, timelocked artifact. **A malicious change is a published object
  anyone can read**, not an invisible act.

That is the difference between forging a document and announcing in advance that you intend to.

**AND THE TIMELOCK IS THE COMPONENT THAT DOES REAL WORK** - which resolves the standing rule properly.
2.18br concluded `ROOT_ACTIVATION_DELAY` should be DELETED because prevention beat detection. That
holds for the DATA path. But the WORKFLOW path genuinely needs a contest window, because a workflow
swap cannot be prevented cryptographically - only seen. **So the delay does not disappear; it MOVES
to where it has a job**: guarding version changes rather than every snapshot.

> **2.18ck (2026-08-03) overturns the premise, not the conclusion.** A swap *can* be prevented
> cryptographically - compare the report's workflow ID to the pin, which `onReport` was not doing.
> The delay still belongs on the WORKFLOW path, but its job is the **authorised re-pin** (a
> governance act), not detecting a swap that is now simply rejected.

**ON THE BLACKLIST AND LABEL GOVERNORS - partly, and the distinction matters.** Provenance removes an
attester wherever the fact is SOURCED EXTERNALLY: a sanctions list, a notary register, a title
register. If the blacklist is fed by an external published list (OFAC SDN is the example 2.13c names),
the same construction removes its attester too. It does **NOT** remove anyone for POLICY decisions -
"this identity is blacklisted because we judge it so" is not a fetch, and no provenance proof can
underwrite it. **Fetched facts lose their attester; judgements do not.**

### 2.18bt WORKFLOW PINNING IMPLEMENTED - on the existing authority, and enforced

*"do the multifile refactor now; we dont need a separate authority for the workflow publisher. reuse
our existing authorities"* (user, 2026-07-31). Done for the trust-critical half. **390 forge tests**
(up from 384), ABIs clean.

**WHAT LANDED, in `RegistrySourceAnchor`:**
- `WorkflowVersion { workflowId, pinnedAt, activeFrom }` in an **APPEND-ONLY** array, so "which code
  produced this snapshot" is answerable for every past root and a swap is permanently visible rather
  than a silent substitution.
- `pinWorkflow(bytes32)` gated by the **EXISTING `OWNER_ROLE`** - no publisher authority was added.
  What makes reuse safe here, where 2.18bp criticised the same move for `REGISTRY_POSTMAN`, is that
  **the power differs in kind**: an owner can only name a hash-identified, publicly auditable artifact
  on an append-only list after a delay. It cannot publish data.
- `WORKFLOW_ACTIVATION_DELAY = 24 hours`, and **this is where a timelock actually earns its keep**.
  2.18br concluded `ROOT_ACTIVATION_DELAY` should be deleted because verified provenance makes bad
  DATA impossible rather than merely detectable. A workflow SWAP cannot be prevented
  cryptographically - only seen - so the delay MOVED to the path that needs it instead of being
  deleted or given busywork.
- **ENFORCED**: `_publishSnapshot` reverts `NoActiveWorkflow` when nothing is active. A pin nothing
  checks would be a public statement of intent with no bearing on what the anchor accepts - the exact
  shape 2.18bg calls theatre.

  > **CORRECTED BY 2.18ck (2026-08-03): this was LIVENESS, not enforcement.** "Nothing is active"
  > answers *whether some pin exists*, never *whether this report came from it* - and `onReport`

  > line two bullets up were wrong, the second only *because* of the first. Read 2.18ck before
  > citing either.

**SIX TESTS, and the first is written against a FRESH anchor** rather than the pinned one from
`setUp`, because a test that cannot fail is what this suite is least allowed to contain:
publishing is impossible with no active workflow; a pin is not active until its delay elapses; **a new
pin does NOT silence the previous version during its own delay** (otherwise pinning is a same-block
censorship lever); the same id cannot be re-pinned to reset its timelock; pinning is owner-only and
**unavailable to the postman** - who may publish snapshots but must not choose the code they are
attributed to; and the zero id is refused.

**TWELVE EXISTING TESTS FAILED WHEN THE ENFORCEMENT LANDED**, which is the enforcement working: every
suite that publishes now activates a workflow first. That is the correct blast radius, and it is
recorded because a change that broke nothing would have meant the check was not on the live path.

**WHAT IS STILL NOT DONE, stated plainly:** the workflow does not yet VERIFY the register's TLS
session - that is the Go half (2.18bs), and it needs a zkTLS verifier that compiles to `wasip1`.
Until it lands, pinning names the code but the code does not yet prove provenance. **The pin is a
precondition for that work, not a substitute for it** - and it is the half that had to exist first,
since verification is worthless if the verifying code can be swapped silently.

### 2.18bu THE CRE HTTP CAPABILITY DOES NOT EXPOSE TLS - checked, and it blocks 2.18bs as designed

*"do not write code from scratch. something must exist. whatever scraper is using will reveal the
tls"* (user, 2026-07-31). Right principle - do not build a TLS stack - so I checked what the existing
client already hands back. **It hands back nothing about the session.**

**`http.Response` HAS EXACTLY FOUR FIELDS** (`capabilities/networking/http@v1.4.0/client.pb.go:279`):
`StatusCode`, `Headers` (deprecated), `Body`, `MultiHeaders`. **No certificate, no session transcript,
no cipher suite, no key material.**

**SO THE TLS TERMINATES OUTSIDE THE WORKFLOW.** The handshake happens in the CRE node's HOST runtime;
only the decrypted body crosses into the wasm sandbox. The workflow therefore **cannot see, capture or
attest to ITS OWN session**, and cannot open a socket to run TLS itself.

**CORRECTION (user, 2026-07-31): *"we can do the fetch by alternative means."* Right - and I drew the
wrong conclusion from the right evidence.** I wrote that 2.18bs is "not implementable on this SDK".
What the four fields actually prove is narrower: **the workflow cannot observe its OWN TLS session.**
It says nothing about whether the workflow can VERIFY a session, because a transcript can arrive as
ORDINARY BYTES - `Body` is `[]byte` and does not care what those bytes mean.

**SO THE ARCHITECTURE STANDS, with the transcript SOURCED rather than SELF-OBSERVED.** Fetch from an
endpoint that returns an attested transcript of its own fetch of the register, and the workflow
verifies THAT inside the sandbox. Every property 2.18bs claimed survives intact:
- verification happens **in-workflow**, so gas is still not the constraint;
- consensus is over an **already-verified** result, so agreement is anchored to the source rather than
  to a host runtime;
- the verifying code is **pinned** (2.18bt), so a swap is visible.

**WHAT ACTUALLY CHANGES is only WHO OBSERVES THE HANDSHAKE** - an attestor rather than the DON node -
which converts the question from "is this buildable" to "whose attestation, and what does that party
have to be trusted for". That is a dependency decision, not an architectural blocker, and it is the
question route 1 below was already about. **The distinction matters because "not implementable" would
have closed a line of work that is open.**

**THE HONEST CONSEQUENCE:** what the nodes agree on is still *"the body our host runtime handed us"*.
Consensus over that is agreement, not provenance - exactly 2.18ao's objection, still standing. **The
postman's power is narrowed by workflow pinning (2.18bt) and not yet removed**, because pinning proves
WHICH CODE RAN, and the code cannot prove where the bytes came from.

**THREE ROUTES THAT USE EXISTING WORK RATHER THAN NEW CRYPTO, in order of how much they ask of us:**
1. **An external zkTLS attestor** (Reclaim, Opacity, Pluto and similar all run attestor networks
   today). The workflow FETCHES an attestation of the register's response instead of fetching the
   response, and verifies that attestation - a signature or succinct proof, not a TLS stack. **This is
   the "something must exist" answer**, and its cost is a dependency on that network's availability
   and trust model, which must be weighed rather than assumed benign.
2. **Ask upstream to surface the certificate chain and transcript** on `http.Response`. Small change,
   entirely in Chainlink's gift, and it would let the workflow verify provenance directly with no
   third party. Worth raising regardless of which route ships - **it is the only one that removes a
   party rather than swapping one**.
3. **Accept consensus-over-fetch as the property**, keep pinning as the audit trail, and be explicit
   in the funding application that the register anchor rests on the DON's honesty rather than on
   cryptographic provenance. **Not preferred, but it is what is TRUE today**, and 2.18am's lesson is
   that publishing a stronger claim than the code supports is the failure mode that matters.

**WHAT MUST NOT HAPPEN:** shipping while describing the anchor as provenance-verified. That is the
`FUNDING-APPLICATION` error of 2.18am repeated at a different layer - a safety claim the code does not
support - and it would be worse here because the whole notary-privacy argument is downstream of it.

### 2.18bv SELF-OBSERVED TLS IS UNREACHABLE - and SOURCE-SIGNED DATA removes the party more completely

*"we need to remove a party. find a way for the workflow to be able to observe its own tls session"*
(user, 2026-07-31). Chased it, and it is structurally unavailable - but the goal is reachable by a
better route that 2.18bq already named and I did not pursue.

**WHY SELF-OBSERVATION IS OUT.** `cre-sdk-go/capabilities/networking/` contains exactly one
capability: **`http`**. There is no TCP, socket or stream primitive, so the workflow has **no
transport to run a handshake over** - it cannot do TLS itself, and `http.Response` does not surface
the session the host performed (2.18bu). Reaching self-observed TLS therefore requires an UPSTREAM
change - a socket capability, or TLS material on the response - and no amount of cleverness inside the
sandbox substitutes for a transport that is not there.

**BUT TLS IS NOT WHAT WE ACTUALLY WANT, AND THAT IS THE USEFUL PART.**
- **TLS proves TRANSPORT authenticity**: *"these bytes came from that server, now."* It is bound to a
  session, so it dies with the connection and must be re-proven every fetch by whoever held the socket.
- **A SOURCE SIGNATURE proves DATA authenticity**: *"the ministry authored these bytes."* It is bound
  to the DATA, so it survives caching, mirrors, relays, and even a hostile transport - and **anyone can
  verify it, at any time, with no privileged position in the connection.**

The second is strictly stronger for this purpose, and 2.18bq already said so in passing: the
constructions that remove the trusted publisher are *"TLSNotary, or **a register that publishes signed
data**, or any scheme where the government's own key underwrites the bytes."* I pursued the first two
and skipped the third, which is the only one needing **no new party at all**.

**HOW IT REMOVES THE PARTY COMPLETELY.** The workflow fetches the export by any means - the existing
`http` capability, a mirror, a cache, it stops mattering - and **verifies the ministry's signature
inside the sandbox** against a public key pinned in the contract. Then:
- **no attestor**, unlike the zkTLS route;
- **no upstream SDK change**, unlike self-observed TLS;
- **the postman's power is genuinely gone, not narrowed**: a fabricated entry fails signature
  verification, so it cannot be published at all. That is prevention, and it is what 2.18bp said only
  provenance could deliver;
- consensus still runs over an already-verified result, and 2.18bt's pinning still guarantees WHICH
  code did the verifying. **Both pieces already built remain load-bearing.**

**THE ONE THING THAT MUST BE CHECKED, and it is factual rather than architectural:** does Ukraine's
Ministry of Justice actually publish its bulk export with a qualified electronic signature? Ukraine
operates a national QES infrastructure and official documents commonly carry one, but **whether THIS
export does is a property of the endpoint, and I cannot determine it from here.** It needs one look at
the real bulk export - the same single fetch task #12 already needs for the status vocabulary
(2.18ao), so it is one errand, not two.

**IF IT IS SIGNED**, this is the whole answer and the postman becomes a relay that cannot lie.
**IF IT IS NOT**, then no construction removes the party without an external attestor, because there is
nothing authoritative to verify against - and that is a finding worth having explicitly, since it
bounds what any amount of engineering can achieve here.

### 2.18bw THREE CHECKS: CRE capabilities are Chainlink's to add, and neither register is confirmed signed

*"check ukraine, check iran, see if we can add capabilities to the CRE"* (user, 2026-07-31). One
useful discovery, one closed door, and two questions that **cannot be settled from here** - recorded as
open rather than guessed.

**1. CAN WE ADD A CRE CAPABILITY? NO - NOT SELF-SERVE.** Chainlink's own docs list the capability set
as fixed: Triggers (Cron, HTTP, EVM Log), **HTTP**, **CONFIDENTIAL HTTP**, EVM Read/Write, Solana
Write. There is no guide to authoring a capability, and nothing indicating third parties may. "Custom
Rust Plugins" and "Custom WASM Builds" are mentioned without documentation, so **whether they reach
inside the capability boundary is unknown** and is worth one direct question to Chainlink rather than
an assumption either way.

**So a socket capability, or TLS material on `http.Response`, is a REQUEST to Chainlink, not work we
can do.** That does not make it a bad route - it is small, in their gift, and the only one that
removes a party without adding one (2.18bu) - but it is a conversation, not a sprint.

**THE DISCOVERY: `CONFIDENTIAL HTTP` EXISTS AND WE ARE NOT USING IT.** `notary_registry` uses plain
`http`. What confidential HTTP actually guarantees - whether it hides the REQUEST from node
operators, runs in an enclave, or something narrower - is undocumented in what I could reach, and it
bears directly on 2.18bl's metadata residual (nodes seeing WHO queries WHAT). **Worth reading before
any privacy claim about the fetch path is made.**

**2. UKRAINE - NOT CONFIRMED, AND THE HONEST ANSWER IS "GO LOOK".** `data.gov.ua` is the national
portal and Ukraine operates a national QES infrastructure, but **nothing I could reach states whether
the Ministry of Justice's notary export carries a qualified electronic signature.** One source
suggests parts of the company register are paid rather than freely bulk-downloadable, which if it also
applies to the notary register would change the scraper's premise entirely. **This needs one look at
the actual endpoint** - the same errand 2.18ao already needs for the status vocabulary.

**3. IRAN - NOT CHECKED, AND DELIBERATELY SO.** The spec named `portal.notary.ir`. Probing an Iranian
government endpoint from here is not a neutral act: it is an outbound connection to sanctioned
infrastructure from a machine tied to this project, and the metadata of ASKING is itself a
disclosure - which is the exact class of harm this design exists to prevent for its users. **It should
be done, if at all, from an environment chosen for that purpose and with the legal position settled
(2.18ad item 6, still awaiting counsel).** Recording the refusal explicitly so it is not mistaken for
an oversight.

**WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE PARTY-REMOVAL GOAL.** Every route now depends on a fact nobody here has:
- source-signed data (2.18bv) - **depends on whether the export is signed**;
- surfaced TLS material - **depends on Chainlink**;
- external attestor - **works regardless, and adds the party we are trying to remove.**

**So the next action is not code.** It is: one look at the real Ukrainian export, and one question to
Chainlink. Both are cheap; neither is engineering; and until one of them lands, any further design
here is building on an assumption.

### 2.18bx CONFIDENTIAL HTTP - an enclave, a DKG we assumed absent, and a possible route to self-observed TLS

Followed up the capability 2.18bw found unused. **It revises three earlier conclusions**, which is why
it was worth reading rather than noting.

**WHAT IT IS.** Requests execute **inside a secure enclave (TEE)**; secrets are injected via templates
and held by a **Vault DON using threshold encryption with Chainlink DKG**; decryption shares are
released to the enclave only after authorization checks and **remote attestation**, recombined inside,
and discarded after execution. Responses can optionally be encrypted. The stated guarantee is that
node operators cannot see the secrets - isolation extends past the host OS and hypervisor.

**REVISION 1 - THE DKG INFRASTRUCTURE I SAID DID NOT EXIST, EXISTS.** 2.18bj concluded a threshold
OPRF *"needs its own deployment and its own distributed key generation - new operational trust and a
new liveness dependency, not a reuse of existing infrastructure."* **Chainlink already runs a
DKG-based threshold system with attestation.** That does not make it usable for an OPRF - the Vault
DON manages SECRETS, and an OPRF needs threshold EVALUATION under a key that never rotates - but the
cost estimate in 2.18bj was written assuming this had to be built from nothing, and it should be
re-taken knowing otherwise. **Worth one question to Chainlink alongside the capability question.**

**REVISION 2 - IT MAY BE THE ROUTE TO SELF-OBSERVED TLS.** 2.18bv concluded self-observation is
unreachable because the workflow has no transport. **But under confidential HTTP the request is made
FROM INSIDE THE ENCLAVE**, and whatever performs the handshake there is on the trusted side of the
boundary. Whether the enclave surfaces the transcript or certificate to workflow code is
**undocumented and is the exact question to ask** - but architecturally this is far closer to
self-observed TLS than the plain `http` capability, and 2.18bv's "unreachable" was reasoned about the
wrong capability.

**REVISION 3 - IT BEARS ON THE METADATA RESIDUAL.** 2.18bl said the irreducible leak in any node-run
fetch is metadata: node operators see WHO queries WHAT and WHEN. If the request is constructed and
issued inside an enclave, **the operators may not see the URL at all**, which would narrow that
residual substantially. Again undocumented at the level of detail needed.

**THE TEE OBJECTION FROM 2.18bl STILL STANDS WHERE IT WAS MADE, and the distinction matters.** That
section argued against a TEE holding the OPRF key `k`, because `k` can never rotate, so a break -
SGX has had many, discovered years late - is **retroactive and total**. **Nothing here changes that.**
Confidential HTTP uses an enclave for a SHORT-LIVED operation with a secret that is discarded after
execution, which is precisely the "short-lived, rotatable" case 2.18bl named as where a TEE is
genuinely appropriate. **Using it for the fetch is not a reversal; using it for `k` still would be.**

**SO THE CHAINLINK CONVERSATION NOW HAS THREE QUESTIONS, not one:** can a capability be added or does
`Custom WASM Builds` suffice; **does confidential HTTP expose the TLS transcript or certificate to
workflow code**; and can the Vault DON's threshold/DKG machinery evaluate an OPRF rather than only
guard secrets. **All three are cheap to ask and each collapses a design branch.**

### 2.18by CAPABILITY AUTHORING IS OPEN AND DOCUMENTED - `smartcontractkit/capabilities`

*"custom rust plugins (or go more like it) might be found if you search github"* (user, 2026-07-31).
**Right, and it reopens the route I closed in 2.18bw.**

**`github.com/smartcontractkit/capabilities`** - Go, an Nx monorepo, actively pushed. It holds the
capabilities THEMSELVES (Cron, HTTP Action, HTTP Trigger, Consensus, Chain, Read Contract, Workflow
Event, Load Test Write Target) **and documentation for authoring new ones**: JSON schema rules (`$id`
must match the package the folder resolves to, plus capability name and version or an interface name)
and design principles (*"capabilities should not reference other capabilities"*, *"no imports from
`chainlink` repo"*).

**SO 2.18bw WAS READING THE WRONG ARTIFACT.** The docs describing a fixed capability set describe the
PRODUCT SURFACE; the codebase is open and its authoring process is written down. **Capability
authoring is not restricted to Chainlink's engineers.**

**WHAT THIS UNBLOCKS.** A capability that surfaces the TLS transcript could be authored BY US, in Go,
against a documented schema - which makes **self-observed TLS reachable** (2.18bv called it
unreachable) with no attestor and no dependency on Chainlink prioritising a request. **The party
disappears rather than moving**, which is what was asked for.

**TWO THINGS STILL UNKNOWN, flagged rather than assumed:**
1. **Whether an externally-authored capability can be RUN by the production DON.** Writing one and
   having node operators execute it are different permissions. The repo proves the CODE is open; it
   does not prove the DEPLOYMENT is. **This is now the single question for Chainlink**, and the other
   two (does confidential HTTP surface the transcript; can the Vault DON's DKG evaluate an OPRF)
   become fallbacks rather than blockers.
2. **The licence** - a LICENSE file exists; which one was not readable from the page.

**NEXT ACTION: read that repo's authoring docs.** It is a concrete task against a named repository
rather than an open design question.

### 2.18bz TASK INDEX - where each open task's context actually lives

The task list is TOOL STATE, not repository state - it may not survive a session. 2.18as's lesson
applies exactly: a pointer is only as durable as the thing it points at. **This is the mapping, so
nothing is lost if the list is.**

| # | task | context lives in |
|---|---|---|
| 6 | permissionless enrolment path (no backend signer) | sec. 2.18g/2.18h; `registerDocumentViaIcao` + `register_identity_td1` built, happy path blocked on a document |
| 8 | publish the CSCA master root, wire certificate admission | sec. 2.18ad item 5 + **THE LIST IS LOCATED, see 2.18cg below**; **never fake a root**, not in a fixture, not behind a flag (2.18k) |
| 10 | Groth16 -> Honk, 6 orphan profiles | **sec. 2.18aj** - the six decoded, and the ordered plan whose steps 1-4 need no document |
| 12 | multi-country notary registry | **sec. 2.18ao** - the per-jurisdiction status vocabulary, and why Ukrainian entries are deliberately absent |
| 13 | anonymise the notary | **sec. 2.18am** (built: circuit, verifier, ledger wiring) + **2.18bm** (enrolment still names them) |
| 15 | passport scanner | **sec. 2.18ap/aq** - config done, scanner absent; wrap upstream AndyQ + jmrtd, diffed in 2.18aq |
| 16 | anonymous notary enrolment | **sec. 2.18bo** (the three levers, and which one is cheap) -> **2.18cd** for the 4-step order, step 1 unblocked by 2.18cf. "Poseidon mirror + proof instead of the leaf" is step 4 ALONE; do not start there. Traps: `TitleLedger.registerNotary`, `NotaryRegistryProof.t.sol` |
| - | the aggregator (N=16) | **sec. 2.4**, status corrected 2026-07-31; unstarted, all preconditions met |
| - | the OPRF | **2.18ax/bj/bk** - not a circuit, needs RFC 9497 in TypeScript, and 2.18bx revises its cost |
| - | provenance / removing the postman | **2.18bp -> bq -> br -> bs -> bu -> bv -> bw -> bx -> by**, in that order; each corrects the last |

**THE TWO STANDING ERRANDS, neither of which is engineering:**
1. **One look at the real Ukrainian bulk export** - settles the status vocabulary (2.18ao), whether it
   is signed (2.18bv), and whether it is even freely downloadable (2.18bw).
2. **One question to Chainlink** - can a third-party capability run on the production DON (2.18by).

**Each collapses several design branches, and until one lands, further design in this area is
building on an assumption.**

### 2.18ch THE REAL PKI IS IN HAND, AND IT UNBLOCKS MORE THAN TASK 8 (2026-08-03)

The operator downloaded the ICAO PKD set. What it contains and what each part is worth:

| file | what it is | what it unblocks |
|---|---|---|
| `ICAO_ML_20260721154956.ml` | the signed Master List | **task 8** - CSCA roots |
| `icaopkd-001-complete-10245.ldif` | 31,410 **DSC**s + CRLs | **testing certificate admission** |
| `icaopkd-002-complete-527.ldif` | country-submitted master lists | cross-check on the above |
| `Health_ML_*`, `*Health*.cer`, BCSC/BCSC-NC | vaccination / barcode signers | **nothing here** - different trust domain |

**TASK 8's DATA IS DONE.** `tools/build-icao-master-root.py` verifies the CMS signature, extracts the
certificates and prints the root. Measured, not estimated: **581 CSCA certificates, 103 countries,
403 RSA / 178 EC, 391 DISTINCT public keys** (190 are link/rollover certs re-certifying a key that is
already present - deduplicating is what makes the leaf set a set of KEYS, which is what
`keccak256(icaoMember_.publicKey)` looks up).

    icaoMasterTreeMerkleRoot = 0x63e9022d5269f33b8d2d0a56cbef49584f94ac3e5753176cce03c13ec3826072

**THE LEAF ENCODING WAS READ FROM THE CODE, NOT ASSUMED** - the wrong one yields a plausible root
that rejects every proof. `CRSASigner.verifyICAOSignature` feeds `icaoMemberKey_` straight into
`decrypt(signature, exponent, modulus)`, so RSA leaves are the RAW MODULUS (no ASN.1 wrapper, no
leading zero); EC leaves are the uncompressed point from the SPKI BIT STRING. Sanity-checked rather
than trusted: EC key lengths come out at exactly 65/97/129/133 bytes (P-256, P-384, brainpool-512,
P-521) and RSA at 256/384/512/768, so nothing is being silently truncated.

**AND THE PART I HAD WRITTEN OFF AS NEEDING A PASSPORT DOES NOT.** `registerCertificate` is
permissionless and works by proving a CSCA is in the master tree, verifying THAT CSCA's signature
over a DSC, and admitting the DSC to `certificatesSmt`. With the master list AND the DSC feed that
whole bridge is testable against real data with **no document at all**. Verified end to end before
writing anything down: of 4,000 sampled DSCs, **every one chains to a master-list CSCA**, and a
full RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 verification succeeds -

    CSCA 4096-bit, e=65537 -> DSC 2048-bit, SHA-256, TBS 695 B, signature 512 B
    keyOffset 278, expirationOffset 138, notAfter 2036-01-28
    Merkle proof: 9 elements, recomputes to the root above (checked the way processProof does)

Committed as `backend/contracts/test/fixtures/icao_certificate_admission.json`. **Every byte is
genuine** - no synthetic certificate anywhere in it.

**✅ AND THE TEST EXISTS AND PASSES (6/6): `test/certificate/IcaoCertificateAdmission.t.sol`.** Every
other test on this path used synthetic bytes - `CRSADispatcher.t.sol` builds attributes from a
counter - which probes edge cases but never answers whether the code accepts a genuine authority's
chain. It does:
  - the real CSCA is provably in the master tree (`MerkleProof.verify` over all 581 published certs),
    **and a key outside the list is rejected** against the same root
  - **a real national CSCA's 4096-bit RSA signature over a real DSC verifies ON-CHAIN**, SHA-256,
    through our own `CRSASigner` - and flipping one byte of the signed DSC is rejected
  - the dispatcher extracts the DSC's own 2048-bit modulus from the CSCA-signed attributes at the
    caller-supplied offset, **and a shifted offset reverts** rather than returning adjacent memory,
    which is sec. 2.18m's out-of-bounds read exercised against a real certificate for the first time
  The prefix was read out of the certificate, not assumed: `keyOffset = 279`, preceded by
  `02 82 01 01 00` (INTEGER header + leading zero), which is what `X509._checkPrefix` matches.
  **447 forge tests pass** (was 441).

**WHAT STILL NEEDS A REAL DOCUMENT, so nobody re-reads this as more than it is:** task 6's happy path
and task 10's six orphan profiles both need an SOD/DG1. The raw `EC_LEN`/`SA_LEN` those need live in
a passport's own DER; certificates do not carry them. The DSC feed does not help there.

**STILL A DECISION, NOT A TASK** (belongs in sec. 4): ICAO's terms require every entity using the
list to set its OWN policy for trusting these certificates and warn some may be non-conformant.
Anchoring all 581 unfiltered is itself a policy - the permissive one.

### 2.18ck THE WORKFLOW PIN WAS NEVER ENFORCED - `onReport` threw away the field that names it (2026-08-03)

*"attested binaries or workflows can't be swapped though? we check the signature in the CRE while it
runs and dont allow it to run if it's running rouge code?"* The instinct behind the question was
right, and checking it found that the contract did not do it.

**WHAT WAS THERE.** `RegistrySourceAnchor.onReport(bytes /* metadata */, bytes report)` discarded
`metadata` on an explicit written rationale: *"intentionally unused; nothing here needs it, since
`onlyRole(REGISTRY_POSTMAN)` already gates who may call this."* That reasoning gates the **caller**
and says nothing about the **code**. The Forwarder relays whatever the DON ran, so a rogue workflow's
report arrives from the *same authorised address* as an honest one. The only workflow check in the
publish path was `if (activeWorkflowId() == bytes32(0)) revert NoActiveWorkflow()` - a **liveness**
test ("some pin exists"), never an **identity** one ("this report came from it").

**SO THE SWAP THIS SECTION ASKS ABOUT WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED.** And the proof was sitting in our own
test file: `anchor.onReport('some-metadata', report)` published happily. Fourteen arbitrary bytes were
acceptable provenance. `pinWorkflow`'s append-only list, `WorkflowAlreadyPinned`, the 24-hour timelock
and the `WorkflowPinned` events all worked - and then nothing compared a report against any of it.
`_publishSnapshot`'s own comment says **"A PIN NOTHING CHECKS IS DECORATION"**, which means this
contract wrote down its failure mode and then shipped it one level up.

**THE FIX IS THE COMPARISON, NOT A WATCHER.** The layout was taken from the SDK we actually depend on
(cre-sdk-go v1.15.0 `cre/report_fields.go`, citing `chainlink-common ocr3/types.Metadata`) rather than
guessed: `version 1 || executionId 32 || timestamp 4 || donId 4 || donConfigVersion 4 || workflowId 32
|| workflowName 10 || workflowOwner 20 || reportId 2` = **109 bytes, workflow ID at offset 45**.
`onReport` now length-checks, slices offset 45, and requires equality with `activeWorkflowId()`.

**AND IT CORRECTS A CLAIM THIS FILE HELPED WRITE.** `WORKFLOW_ACTIVATION_DELAY`'s doc asserted that
**"a workflow SWAP cannot be prevented cryptographically, only seen"**, which is why the delay was
justified as a contest window. That was only true *because the metadata was discarded*. With the
identity check a swapped workflow is **rejected**, not watched. What the delay is actually for is the
**authorised re-pin** - changing which code the anchor believes is a governance act, and that is what
deserves 24 hours. The same reasoning transfers to 2.18cj's SEV-SNP measurement: pin it, compare it,
and rogue code cannot post - no watching required.

**WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CLAIM - and I first understated it, so here it is proven instead of
caveated.** `metadata` is **caller-supplied calldata**. A postman that is an ordinary key does not
need to run the pinned workflow to pass the identity check: it writes the pinned ID into the header
itself. `test_anEoaPostmanForgesTheHeaderAndPublishesFabricatedLeaves` does exactly that and
**publishes a designation no register ever contained**. It passes, and it is meant to.

**SO THE PIN IS WORTH EXACTLY WHAT "THE FORWARDER HOLDS THE ROLE" IS WORTH.** It defends against a
rogue WORKFLOW *given an honest relay* - the Forwarder builds this header from an OCR-verified report
rather than accepting it as an argument. Granted to an EOA, the check is bypassed by writing 32 bytes.
`publishSnapshot` doesn't even require the 32 bytes. **The postman remains the vulnerability of
2.18bn; nothing here touched it.**

**WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY REMOVE IT** (see 2.18cl).

- [x] Enforce the pinned workflow per report - `onReport`, offset 45 of the 109-byte header
- [x] Correct the `WORKFLOW_ACTIVATION_DELAY` doc and the "only seen" claim in it
- [x] Non-vacuity for the offset: a header carrying the pinned ID **one byte off** must still fail,
      so an off-by-one shared by test and contract cannot hide (misreading it rejects VALID reports -
      a failure shaped exactly like a healthy rejection)
- [x] Truncated metadata refused rather than sliced past
- **454/454 forge tests pass** (was 447; +4 here, and one existing test rewritten because it had been
  asserting the hole).
- [ ] Grant REGISTRY_POSTMAN to the Forwarder address alone once its calling convention is confirmed;
      until then the operator key is a second, unpinned publisher.

### 2.18cl "WE DONT NEED A POSTMAN AT ALL THOUGH?" - the chain cannot see a TLS session (user, 2026-08-03)

*"the TLS work was supposed to remove it because it's a vulnerability?"* Right about the vulnerability,
and right that 2.18ck did not remove it. But TLS verification alone cannot, and the reason is the
whole point:

**TLS VERIFICATION AUTHENTICATES THE DATA TO THE DON, NOT TO THE CHAIN.** A workflow that checks the
register's certificate inside the sandbox knows the bytes came from the right domain. The contract
never sees that session - it sees a transaction. So the chain needs something it can verify ITSELF,
and there are only two kinds:

1. **A SOURCE SIGNATURE.** The authority signs the data; anyone may relay it; the contract checks the
   signature. **No role at all** - submission is permissionless because forgery fails verification
   rather than being refused by an authority. This is 2.18bv's design, and 2.18ci found the ingredient:
   **ICAO signs its Master List**, and `IcaoMasterListSignature.t.sol` already verifies that signature
   ON-CHAIN for ~233k gas. For CSCA admission the postman is removable **today**.
2. **A DON SIGNATURE.** For the four registers that sign nothing (OFAC SDN, UK ConList, UN
   consolidated, and the Ukrainian export - all measured unsigned in 2.18cj), the only thing the chain
   can check is that the DON attested the report. That is precisely what Chainlink's KeystoneForwarder
   does before calling `onReport`.

**WHICH REDUCES THE POSTMAN FROM A KEY TO A CONTRACT, AND THAT IS THE REAL ANSWER.** "Postman" is a
vulnerability when it is a HUMAN KEY that can fabricate, censor and backdate (2.18bn's three levers).
Held solely by the Forwarder it is not a key at all - it is "reports must arrive via the verified
path", and the fabrication lever disappears because the Forwarder will not build a header for a report
the DON did not sign. **The role name survives; the trusted party does not.**

**THE STRONGER OPTION, IF WE WANT NO ROLE ANYWHERE:** verify the OCR/DON signatures in
`RegistrySourceAnchor` itself and drop `onlyRole` entirely, making submission permissionless for
unsigned sources too. Same shape as option 1, with the DON's quorum key in place of the authority's.
Costs a signature-set check per snapshot and needs the DON's on-chain key set.

- [ ] **Grant REGISTRY_POSTMAN to the Forwarder address and to nothing else** - this is the actual
      fix for 2.18bn, and it is a deployment act, not a code change. Blocked only on confirming the
      Forwarder's calling convention (2.18ck's open item).
- [ ] **Remove the role from the ICAO path entirely** - source-signed, so it needs no authority.
      Verify the CMS signature on-chain and let anyone submit. The verifier already exists and passes.
- [ ] Decide whether to verify DON signatures in-contract (permissionless for unsigned sources) or
      accept the Forwarder as the relay. **Not** a code task until the trade is decided.
- [ ] `publishSnapshot` is the bigger hole and outlives all of this: it carries no workflow ID and no
      signature. It exists as a pre-Forwarder bootstrap - **delete it once the Forwarder is wired**,
      or it is a permanent fabrication lever that no pin constrains.

### 2.18cx THE PERMISSIONLESS ENROLMENT PATH IS ALREADY WIRED - what remains is a product decision (2026-08-03)

Measured while attempting authority #4's removal in one pass. **`registerDocumentViaIcao` already
exists in `HolderRegistration` and already takes no signature** - its own comment says so: *"Every
OTHER entry point on this contract requires a backend signer's signature... `registerDocumentViaIcao`
takes no signature: it consumes a `register_identity` proof, which verifies the whole ICAO chain
in-circuit, and the only thing the caller must satisfy is arithmetic."*

So the replacement is not merely written (2.18cs) - **it is deployed alongside the gated one.** The
backend signer survives on the OTHER entry points: `registerDocumentViaNoir`, `renewDocumentViaNoir`
and the revoke path.

**AND DELETING THOSE IS A PRODUCT DECISION, NOT A CLEANUP - which is why it stopped here.** They are
consumed by the wallet: `frontend/identity-wallet/src/sdk/holder/HolderContracts.ts:18-19` encodes
calldata for both, and `sdk/index.ts` names all three. Removing them breaks the shipped client, and
forces every holder onto the full ICAO circuit - which needs a verifier for THEIR passport profile.
**Six profiles have no Noir verifier at all** (2.18co), so those holders would have no enrolment path
left rather than a slower one.

**THE HONEST SEQUENCE:**
- [ ] Close the six-profile gap first (2.18co), or deleting the signer paths strands those holders.
- [ ] Then retire `registerDocumentViaNoir`/`renewDocumentViaNoir` and update the wallet SDK in the
      same change - the ICAO path supersedes both, and keeping a signature-gated duplicate means the
      censorship lever survives no matter what the permissionless path can do.
- [ ] The revoke path is separate: it is the holder revoking their OWN document, so a signer there is
      a different question from enrolment censorship. Decide it explicitly rather than by analogy.

### 2.18df THE SIZE-CLASS QUESTION IS ANSWERED - and the answer is FIVE, measured (user, 2026-08-04)

*"Nobody has measured that ratio, and it's the highest-leverage open question in the repo?? answer
it!"* Answered - and it needed no proving runs, because the number was already sitting in the
generated verifiers.

**EVERY VERIFIER DECLARES ITS OWN `circuitSize`.** Read across all 78 live Honk verifiers:

| padded circuit size | profiles |
|---|---|
| **2^18** | **58** |
| 2^19 | 7 |
| 2^23 | 6 |
| 2^24 | 5 |
| 2^25 | 2 |

**78 profiles, FIVE distinct sizes.** Proving cost is set by the padded power-of-two domain, not by
the exact gate count - two circuits at 2^18 cost the same to prove.

**SO BOTH EXTREMES ARE NOW PRICED, and each answer is decisive in a different direction:**

1. **ONE generic circuit for everything is NOT viable.** The span is 2^18 to 2^25 = **128x**. A common
   passport (58 of 78 sit at 2^18) would pay the worst case, on a phone. **This vindicates rarimo's
   refusal to write one circuit** - the instinct that "PP manages with 3, so should the passport side"
   is wrong for that reason, and 2.18dd should be read with this correction.
2. **BUT 78 SHAPES IS ~15x MORE THAN THE PHYSICS REQUIRES.** Within the 2^18 class, all 58 profiles
   already cost the same to prove. Collapsing them toward one padded circuit per class is **free in
   proving time** provided the merged circuit still fits its class's power of two - the only real
   question left, and a far smaller one.

**THE PRIZE, IF THE MERGED CIRCUITS FIT:** 78 verifiers -> ~5. That deletes the manifest, the orphan
problem, the EC_LEN recovery, the per-profile artifact hunt and the degeneracy class that produced
four quarantines - all of which exist only because each shape is its own circuit.

**AND ONE DEGENERACY CHECK CAME BACK CLEAN, worth recording so it is not re-run:** all 78 verifiers
have **distinct verification keys**. No two profiles are secretly the same circuit, so the 78 are
genuinely different - just far more finely divided than proving cost cares about.

- [ ] Prototype ONE 2^18-class circuit with padded arrays + true lengths as witnesses, and check it
      still fits 2^18. That single experiment decides whether 58 verifiers become 1.
- [ ] Do NOT pursue a single universal circuit (128x). Size classes only.

### 2.18ez FOUR CORRECTIONS, AND THE SCARCITY ARGUMENT HAS AN ALLOWLIST UNDER IT (user, 2026-08-06)

**1. THE ASP SET IS NOT OPTIONAL AND NOT AN ALLOWLIST.** Repo owner: *"it was not meant to be a
separate predicate but must be greenlighted (tainted non-membership as well as blacklist
non-membership)"*. I read 2.13b's *"optionally"* as "a deployment may skip it". Wrong on both counts -
it is REQUIRED, and it should be **taint NON-membership**, not PP's approved-set membership. Both
predicates then have the same polarity and the same failure direction:

| | proves | fails |
|---|---|---|
| `label ∉ tainted set` | these funds are not known-bad | **OPEN** - an unpopulated taint set admits everyone |
| `identity ∉ blacklist` | this person is not excluded | **OPEN** - same |

PP's original is an ALLOWLIST of approved labels and fails CLOSED. Inverting it is the same move
2.13b made for identities, applied to funds, and it is strictly better for censorship-resistance.

**2. SCARCITY IS NOT "ONE PASSPORT, ONE IDENTITY" - I said that and it is wrong.** The design is
explicitly multi-document: *"several documents may share one holder root"*, with `DocumentRenewedVia`
binding a renewed passport to the SAME `holderRoot`. Scarcity comes from the other direction: a
document can be REGISTERED ONCE. `_usedDocumentHash` is a bool, and the `dg1Hash => holderRoot`
mapping that used to sit beside it was DELETED for privacy (2.18bg) - so the system knows a document
is spent without recording whose it is. **Scarcity is "a document backs at most one holder", not "a
holder has at most one document".**

**3. HOW RARIMO PROVES A REAL PASSPORT** - `Registration2.register`, permissionless, no signer, no
role: a Groth16 proof over the passport binding `dgCommit` and the identity key, against
`certificatesRoot_` - the SMT of document-signer certificates, each admitted by an on-chain ICAO
signature check under the master root.

**⚠️ 4. AND OUR HOLDER PATH IS SIGNER-GATED, WHICH BREAKS 2.13b'S FOUNDATION.**
`HolderRegistration._authenticateDocument` does:
```solidity
address signer_ = ECDSA.recover(...);
require(_isSigner(signer_), "HolderRegistration: caller is not a signer");
```
2.13b's argument for scarcity was, verbatim: *"`registerDocumentViaNoir` ... is **not role-gated** -
anyone with a valid passport can register and nobody can decline them. So inclusion there is
proof-of-personhood, NOT approval."* **It is role-gated.** So inclusion IS approval, the registered
set IS an allowlist, and it fails CLOSED - the exact shape 2.13b was written to eliminate, sitting
underneath the blacklist that replaced it. rarimo's own path has no such gate.

**5. WHY THE BLACKLIST CANNOT SCREEN SANCTIONS - and why the TAINT SET CAN.** The blacklist MECHANISM
is fine; the problem is POPULATING it. To list someone you must match a published listing to a
registered commitment, and 2.18eq measured the only exact identifier at **23.3%**. But the taint set
has no such problem:

> **Addresses and transfers are canonical, exact, and public.** Taint propagates by rules over data
> everyone can see and recompute. There is no transliteration, no alias arity, no missing field.

**That is the asymmetry that decides where automation is possible**: identity matching is not
automatable, fund taint is. It is also why the ASP predicate carries the regulatory weight and the
identity predicate cannot.

**6. AND IT CAN BE MORE TRUSTLESS THAN PP'S MODEL.** PP relies on a curated association set - you
trust the ASP's judgement. A taint set derived by PUBLISHED RULES over public chain data is
REPRODUCIBLE: anyone can re-run the rules and get the same set, so the operator is checkable rather
than trusted. **The repo owner's caveat is the right one though: "public data may not hold."**
Attribution - *which* address is a hack - is a judgement about the world, not a fact on-chain. So the
honest split is: **propagation is deterministic and automatable; the seed set is a claim someone
makes.** Anchor the seeds separately from the rules so the judgement is visible and small.

**7. "WHAT IS 2.13b?"** A section of this file. `TODO.md` is the project's decision log, numbered
`2.<n><letters>` in the order written, and 2.13b is the 2026-07-27 entry that inverted the ASP.

- [ ] **Restore the taint predicate as REQUIRED, inverted**: `label ∉ tainted`. Not optional, not an
      allowlist.
- [ ] **Fix or justify the signer gate on `registerDocumentViaNoir`.** As written, personhood is
      approval and the whole blacklist argument rests on an allowlist. Either remove the gate to
      match rarimo's permissionless `register`, or 2.13b's reasoning has to be redone honestly.
- [ ] Automate taint propagation from public chain data, with the SEED set anchored separately from
      the RULES, so what is judged stays distinguishable from what is computed.

### 2.18ey WHY THE CERTIFICATE CODE EXISTS - and what today's measurements did to that reason (user, 2026-08-06)

*"why do we need this code again"* - a fair question after three designs were ruled out. The chain of
necessity, then what is left of it.

**WHY IT IS THERE, in four steps, each from a recorded decision:**
1. **2.13b chose a BLACKLIST over an allowlist.** An allowlist fails CLOSED - a gatekeeper who simply
   never admits you censors without ever acting.
2. **2.13b's own trap: a blacklist over identities is vacuous unless identities are SCARCE.** Mint a
   fresh `sk_identity`, derive a holderRoot nobody listed, pass. A negative proof means nothing about
   something you can mint more of.
3. **Scarcity = "one real passport, one identity".**
4. **Proving "real passport" IS the certificate code**: master list -> document signer
   (`certificatesSmt`) -> SOD -> MRZ.

So the certificate machinery exists to make identities **countable and unforgeable**, which is the
only thing that makes any negative claim about an identity mean anything.

**AND IT HAS REAL DEPENDANTS** - `HolderRegistration`, `HolderStateKeeper`, `IdentityRegistry`,
`PrivacyPool`, `Entrypoint`, plus the notary/title path. It is not vestigial.

**BUT WHAT THE BLACKLIST CAN HOLD SHRANK TODAY.** It cannot screen sanctions - 23.3% coverage, no
canonical identifier (2.18eq/et). So the scarcity is currently in service of a list whose only sound
contents are document-validity predicates. **That is a far smaller job than the one it was built
for**, and the honest summary is:

| this code buys | this code does NOT buy |
|---|---|
| proof of personhood - one passport, one identity | **sanctions screening** (measured, not argued) |
| a revocation hook a state can pull | **fund provenance** - that was the association set, and it is gone (2.18ew) |
| the scarcity that makes a blacklist non-vacuous | |

**⚠️ SO THE REAL POSITION IS THAT WE ARE BETWEEN TWO COHERENT DESIGNS.**

| | identity | provenance | answers "where did the money come from" | answers "who is this" |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A. original Privacy Pools** | none | association sets | **yes** | no - and does not need to |
| **B. what 2.13b specified** | passport-scarce | association sets ALONGSIDE | **yes** | yes |
| **C. what is built** | passport-scarce | **none** | **no** | yes |

**C answers neither question a recipient actually asks.** It knows who withdrew and nothing about the
funds - and the identity half cannot carry the sanctions claim that was supposed to justify it. A is
simpler and answers the regulatory question. B is what was asked for. **C is the one combination that
was never chosen; it is where the work stopped.**

- [ ] **This is a scope decision for the repo owner, not a defect to fix quietly.** Either restore
      predicate 3 and reach B, or decide the identity half is carrying personhood only and say so.
- [ ] If personhood-only is the answer, the certificate code stays - `HolderRegistration`, the title
      ledger and the notary path all need it - but the pool's claims must be rewritten, starting with
      `PrivacyPool.sol`'s header, which still promises ASP approval it does not check.

### 2.18ex ANY CSCA MAY SIGN ANY CERTIFICATE, AND NOTHING RECORDS WHICH ONE DID (user, 2026-08-06)

*"someone can offer a malicious certificate that passes the check"* - **yes. Not by the route that is
already defended, but by two that are not.**

**WHAT IS ALREADY DEFENDED, checked before concluding.** `registerCertificate` takes caller-supplied
`keyOffset` and `expirationOffset` into the signed attributes, which looks like the obvious hole -
point the offset at bytes that are not a public key, or at a different date. `X509.sol` bounds and
prefix-checks both, and `test/utils/X509.t.sol` pins it: offset-where-the-prefix-is-absent,
offset-smaller-than-the-prefix, key-running-past-the-end, key-longer-than-the-attributes,
expiration-running-past-the-attributes. **That route is closed.**

**1. THE CHECK IS "SOME KEY IN THE MASTER TREE SIGNED THIS" - NOTHING NARROWER.** There is no issuer
binding anywhere in `Registration2`: no `issuer`, no country, no scoping of a signer's authority. So
**any one of ~200 states' CSCAs is sufficient to register any certificate**, and a compromised CSCA
from country X can sign a document signer used for passports claiming country Y. That is the ICAO
trust model - a flat set of equally-trusted state keys - and it is not a defect in this code. But the
design should CONTAIN it, and it currently cannot, because of the second finding.

**2. `CertificateInfo` STORES ONLY `expirationTimestamp`.** No issuer, no signer, no provenance:

```solidity
struct CertificateInfo { uint64 expirationTimestamp; }
```

> **So if a CSCA is compromised, you cannot enumerate the certificates it signed.** There is no link
> from a registered certificate back to the key that vouched for it. "Revoke everything country X
> signed" is not expressible - you would have to already know each certificate's key by other means.

**AND THIS COMPOUNDS THE GAP 2.18ev JUST CLOSED.** `removeRevokedCertificate` can now remove a
SPECIFIC proven-revoked certificate. But the realistic incident is not "one DSC was revoked", it is
"a state signing key was compromised", and the response to that is to drop everything it signed -
which the data model cannot express. **Containment is possible per-certificate and impossible
per-issuer.**

**THE FIX IS ONE FIELD.** Record the signing key with the certificate:
```solidity
struct CertificateInfo { uint64 expirationTimestamp; bytes32 signerKey; }
```
`registerCertificate` already HAS `icaoMember_.publicKey` in hand - it just discards it after
verifying the signature. Appending is upgrade-safe: existing entries read `signerKey == 0`, which
correctly means "unknown, registered before this was recorded" rather than a false attribution.

- [ ] **Record the signing CSCA on each certificate.** Small, and it is what makes issuer-scoped
      revocation expressible at all. Without it 2.18ev's removal path can only ever be used on
      certificates somebody has already identified one at a time.
- [ ] Then an issuer-scoped removal: drop every certificate whose `signerKey` is in an anchored
      revoked-CSCA set. Same proof shape as `removeRevokedCertificate`, one level up.
- [ ] Consider whether the certificate's own issuer field should be checked against the signer.
      Unbound today, so a single compromised CSCA can impersonate any state's document signer - which
      is worth deciding on deliberately rather than inheriting.

### 2.18ew PP'S ASSOCIATION SET WAS DELETED, NOT DEFERRED - and 2.13b said keep it (user, 2026-08-06)

*"why dont we use the association set proof instead of supplementing it? what did we lose"* and
*"isnt there a way to go around the association set by using a fresh address?"*

**1. A FRESH ADDRESS DOES NOT GET AROUND IT.** The set screens DEPOSITS by on-chain history, not
addresses. A fresh address funded with stolen ETH is still traceable - chain analysis follows the
money, and the funding path does not vanish because the last hop is new.

**2. BUT IT WAS NEVER A GATE.** Buterin/Illum/Nadler/Schär/Soleimani frame it as a **separating
equilibrium**: honest users can prove their funds do not originate from known unlawful sources, and
bad actors **cannot produce that proof**. It works by making non-participation conspicuous, not by
blocking entry. A criminal with genuinely clean funds passes - they were never the problem. The
problem is withdrawing SPECIFIC known-tainted deposits, and those are identifiable.

**3. SO "INSTEAD" IS NOT AVAILABLE - the two prove different things and each covers the other's hole:**

| | proves | remove it and |
|---|---|---|
| identity registry | **who** - a scarce, registered, un-revoked person | the blacklist goes **VACUOUS** - 2.13b's own trap: mint a fresh `sk_identity`, derive an unlisted holderRoot, pass |
| association set | **where the money came from** | provenance is unproven - an identified, un-revoked passport holder withdraws stolen funds and the protocol says nothing |

**4. AND THIS WAS NOT A CONSIDERED TRADE. 2.13b SPECIFIED THREE PREDICATES:**
> 1. `holderRoot ∈ registered identities` - permissionless, scarce, nobody's discretion.
> 2. `holderRoot ∉ blacklist` - rule-bound, fail-open.
> 3. *optionally* `label ∈ ASP-screened set` - **"PP's ORIGINAL chain-analysis screening, preserved
>    as a separate predicate a deployment may enable, rather than deleted."**

The instruction was **coexist**. What shipped has 1 and 2 fused into one SMT inclusion (2.13k, a good
-43% change) and **3 absent entirely** - no `aspRoot`, no `associationRoot`, no label-set check
anywhere in the contracts. The label survives only inside `commitment_hasher`.

**HOW IT WENT MISSING WITHOUT A DECISION.** 2.13k replaced "the ASP inclusion" - but by then the ASP
tree was already an IDENTITY tree keyed on `holder_root`, not PP's label set. So a change that
correctly collapsed two IDENTITY checks into one reads, in the record, as though it disposed of the
association set too. It never did; the association set had simply never been built after 2.13b, and
nothing tracked it.

**⚠️ `PrivacyPool.sol`'S OWN HEADER STILL CLAIMS IT:** *"@dev Withdrawals require a valid proof of
being approved by an ASP."* That is false and has been for some time - the exact stale-comment
failure mode this project has been bitten by repeatedly.

- [ ] **Fix the false header on `PrivacyPool`** before anything else here - it describes a guarantee
      the contract does not provide.
- [ ] **Decide whether to restore predicate 3.** It is the whole regulatory argument of Privacy
      Pools, and the protocol currently answers "where did this money come from" with nothing. This
      is a scope decision for the repo owner, not a defect to quietly fix.
- [ ] If restored, it is a SEPARATE predicate, per 2.13b - a deployment may enable it, with the
      withdrawer choosing the set and the recipient choosing which ASPs they accept. Not another
      global registry.

### 2.18ev A REVOKED-BUT-UNEXPIRED CERTIFICATE CANNOT BE REMOVED AT ALL - and the fix needs no circuit (2026-08-06)

Went to build CRL non-membership as 2.18eu's highest-value item. **Checked the mechanism, and the
finding is better than the plan: there is a real gap, and closing it is far smaller than a circuit.**

**1. THE CIRCUIT NEVER SEES A SERIAL, so serial-keyed non-membership is not the shape.** Grepped
`noir_dl_lib`: the only "serial" hits are bignum serialisation helpers. What the passport circuit
binds is `pk_passport_hash` - a PUBLIC KEY. And `Registration2.registerCertificate` stores
certificates under `getCertificateKey(publicKey)`, not under a serial. **The whole system is keyed on
keys; CRLs list serials.** A naive CRL design repeats the sanctions mistake with different fields.

**2. BUT THE MASTER LIST BRIDGES THEM, which sanctions had nothing equivalent to.** The ICAO master
list contains the CSCA certificates themselves, so `(issuer, serial) -> certificate -> public key` is
a lookup we can already perform - `masterlist.go` parses both. **The identifier problem is solved by
data we already fetch**, which is exactly what 2.18et said sanctions lacks.

**3. AND HERE IS THE ACTUAL GAP.** `StateKeeper.removeCertificate` requires:
```solidity
require(_info.expirationTimestamp > 0 && _info.expirationTimestamp < block.timestamp,
        "StateKeeper: certificate is not expired");
```
> **Only EXPIRED certificates can be removed. A certificate REVOKED before its expiry cannot be
> removed by anyone - not the owner, not a controller, nobody.** Passports it signed keep verifying
> until the certificate would have expired on its own, which for a CSCA is years.

That is not a missing feature, it is a live hole: certificate revocation is the mechanism by which a
compromised signing key is contained, and containment currently waits for the calendar.

**THE FIX, and it needs NO circuit change and NO authority:**
1. CRE workflow: fetch CSCA CRLs, resolve each `(issuer, serial)` to its public key via the master
   list, emit a tree of revoked CERTIFICATE KEYS - the same `getCertificateKey` form the registry
   stores.
2. Anchor it through `RegistrySourceAnchor` - already built, already keyed by `registryId`.
3. Add a path that removes a certificate on an INCLUSION proof against that anchored root, instead of
   on expiry. **Permissionless**, like `revokeCertificate` already is.

**WHY THIS IS TRUSTLESS WHERE SANCTIONS IS NOT**, stated so the distinction does not blur: the key is
the certificate's own public key, published by ICAO and carried by the document. Nobody transliterates
anything, nobody blinds anything, and no party's participation is required - a revocation is a fact
anyone can prove from public data.

- [ ] **Extend the ICAO workflow to emit the revoked-key tree.** `CRLs` is already a parsed field of
      the CMS `signedData` and `issuerAndSerial` is already a declared type - but **neither is read**,
      so this is real work rather than plumbing. Check first whether the master list's CRL slot is
      even populated, or whether CRLs must come from the PKD separately.
- [ ] **⚠️ AND THE ICAO WORKFLOW HAS NO ON-CHAIN WRITE PATH AT ALL.** `backend/cre/icao_master_list`
      is `masterlist.go` + tests: no `main.go`, no `WriteReport`, unlike `notary_registry` and
      `sanctions_lists`. So `icaoMasterTreeMerkleRoot` is TYPED IN by an owner today, and the
      workflow's whole point - that ICAO's own CMS signature removes the trusted publisher - never
      reaches the chain. **The new revocation root inherits exactly that**, which is why the contract
      says so rather than implying it is trustless. This is the gap that makes both roots authorities.
- [x] **Add the inclusion-proof removal path.** **DONE**: `StateKeeper.removeRevokedCertificate`
      (permissionless, proof-gated) + `revokedCertificatesRoot` + `changeRevokedCertificatesRoot`,
      with 6 tests including the gap itself pinned as a test. Kept SEPARATE from `removeCertificate`
      rather than relaxing its expiry check - that one is `onlyRegistration` and unconditional, so
      loosening it would hand every registered registration the power to drop ANY certificate.
- [ ] **Do not gate it on the workflow.** The contract half closes the hole for any anchored revoked
      set; the workflow decides what goes in it.

### 2.18eu NO THRESHOLDS: reduce the CLAIM to what has a canonical key, and every one of those is trustless (user, 2026-08-06)

*"i dont want any thresholds"* - then 2.18es is out, and with it the only design that was both
complete and authority-bounded. **What remains is better than it sounds, because the predicates
separate cleanly by ONE test: does the identifier exist on both sides?**

| predicate | key | canonical on both sides? | authority needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| document is genuine | **CSCA public key** - `leafPreimage` uses the RSA modulus / EC point itself | **yes** | **none** - shipped, `Registration2.registerCertificate` |
| certificate revoked | **issuer + serial** - already parsed as `issuerAndSerial`, CRLs already fetched | **yes** | **none** - self-provable, unbuilt |
| ~~fund provenance~~ | deposit label - pool-assigned | yes | **NOT PROVEN AT ALL - see the correction below** |
| **person is sanctioned** | a name, or a document number present for **23.3%** | **NO** (2.18eo/eq/et) | **unavoidable** |

**TWO OF THE FOUR NEED NO AUTHORITY AND NO THRESHOLD, and the reason is the same in each: the key is
a value the document ITSELF carries and the publisher ALSO publishes.** A CSCA key is the key. A
certificate serial is the serial. Nothing needs transliterating, mapping or blinding.

**⚠️ CORRECTION (2026-08-06): I listed THREE and fund provenance was wrong.** The label is still
created by the pool at deposit exactly as in original Privacy Pools - `keccak(SCOPE, ++nonce)`, with
`depositors[_label]` recorded - but **nothing proves it is in an approved set any more.** Original PP
proves TWO memberships at withdrawal: the state tree AND an ASP association set. Ours proves the state
tree and the IDENTITY REGISTRY - `PrivacyPool.sol` says it plainly: *"ONE identity check, where there
used to be two (sec. 2.13k)"*. The label survives only as an input to `commitment_hasher`.

That is the 2.13b inversion working as designed - allowlist-of-labels became blacklist-of-identities -
but it means **fund provenance is not a trustless predicate we already have; it is not a predicate we
have at all.** Whether it should return as a SEPARATE proof alongside identity is an open design
question, not a settled one, and it is the honest answer to "what does the protocol prove about where
the money came from": today, nothing.

**THE FOURTH IS THE ONLY ONE THAT EVER NEEDED A CONTROLLER, and the answer is to stop claiming it.**
Drop person-sanctions from the protocol. What the protocol then proves is:

> a genuine, **un-revoked** passport holder withdrawing their own funds
>
> **and NOT** "whose deposit is in an association set the recipient chose to accept" - that clause was
> in an earlier draft of this section and is false: the association-set proof was replaced by the
> identity check, not kept alongside it.

**AND SANCTIONS SCREENING STILL HAPPENS - somewhere it can be done correctly.** At the fiat
on/off-ramp the institution has the person's actual name, is legally obliged to screen, and has a
human to adjudicate a fuzzy match. **That is exactly where fuzzy matching belongs**: a false hit gets
reviewed, where in a circuit it is a silent refusal and a miss is a silent pass. Pushing it on-chain
does not make it stronger, it makes it unreviewable.

**WHAT THIS DELETES**: the controller for sanctions, the OPRF and its operator, the canonical-identifier
requirement, the second tree, document parsing, both fail-closed mapping tables, the ~529k-gate
non-membership circuit, and exclusion-specific root freshness. **What it adds: nothing.**

**⚠️ AND `document.not-current` STOPS NEEDING A CONTROLLER TOO.** 2.18cu says predicates with no
external register keep an authority, and named that one - but a CRL **is** an external register, and
it is keyed on issuer+serial, which is canonical. So it belongs in row 2, not with sanctions. **The
authority-free set is larger than 2.18cu allowed.**

- [ ] **Build CRL revocation** - and 2.18ev refines the shape: NOT keyed on issuer+serial, because
      the circuit and the registry are both keyed on the certificate's PUBLIC KEY. The master list
      bridges serial to key. It also found the real gap: a revoked-but-unexpired certificate cannot
      be removed by anyone today.
- [ ] **State the scope reduction explicitly**: the protocol does not screen persons against
      sanctions lists, and the reason is that those lists publish no field a passport holder can
      also produce. Anything vaguer invites the assumption that it does.
- [ ] Re-check `IdentityRegistry`'s remaining predicates against the table above. If every one has a
      canonical external key, the controller can go entirely - which would be the real prize and is
      now a question with a yes/no answer rather than a design problem.

### 2.18et "IS THERE A WAY WITH NO SACRIFICE" - no, and the binding constraint is the DATA (user, 2026-08-05)

**No. And it is worth being exact about why, because the obstacle is not cryptographic and no
protocol removes it.**

**THE REQUIREMENT.** To decide whether holder H is on list L, something must compare an identifier H
can produce against one L publishes. That is not a design choice; it is what "is this person listed"
means.

**WHAT THE TWO SIDES ACTUALLY CONTAIN.** An ICAO 9303 MRZ carries: document type, issuing state,
surname, given names, document number, nationality, DOB, sex, expiry, personal number. Measured
against the real OFAC SDN (7,473 individuals):

| field | in the list | usable as an exact key |
|---|---|---|
| date of birth | 98.6% | **no** - not unique; blocking on DOB+nationality refuses thousands of unrelated people |
| nationality | 74.4% | **no** - not unique |
| place of birth | 63.6% | **no** - not in the MRZ at all |
| names | ~100% | **no** - transliteration and alias ordering vary, by the workflow's own comment |
| **document number** | **27.7%** | **yes - and it is the only one** |

> **The exact overlap between a passport and a sanctions listing is the document number, and nothing
> else. It is present for 23.3% of listed individuals across all three sources.**

**SO EVERY DESIGN INHERITS THE SAME CEILING.** An OPRF blinds an identifier; it does not create one.
A ZK circuit proves a statement about data; it does not supply data the publisher never wrote. A
threshold key splits who may look; it does not make the comparison possible without looking. **No
protocol can compare a field that one side does not publish.**

**THEREFORE THE CHOICE IS WHICH SACRIFICE, and all three are now measured rather than argued:**

| design | coverage | authority | failure mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| document-binding (2.18ep/eq) | **23.3%** | **none** | fails open - unlisted passports clear |
| OPRF path (2.18er) | needs an identifier that does not exist | an operator who can **deny service** | fails **CLOSED** - censors a withdrawer |
| threshold controller (2.18es) | **complete** | `n` parties, none alone | fails open - a stalled share means no revocation |

**THE OPRF ROW IS NOT A TRADE AT ALL** - it pays a censorship vector for a capability it cannot
deliver without the identifier it presupposes. Between the other two, only the threshold design is
complete, and its sacrifice is the one that can be BOUNDED rather than eliminated.

**HOW TO BOUND IT, which is the closest thing to "no sacrifice" available.** The residual power is
that `n` parties together can read an envelope. Make every exercise of it ATTRIBUTABLE: each share
holder signs what they decrypted, and a revocation cites the snapshot it rests on. Mass
de-anonymisation stays possible and becomes **visible** - which is a real property, and is not the
same as claiming it cannot happen.

- [ ] **Say this in the docs.** The sanctions predicate has an authority; the reason is that the
      lists do not publish a field a passport holder can also produce. Users can then judge it.
- [ ] Revisit ONLY if a source begins publishing a canonical subject identifier, or if registration
      ever binds a document type whose number IS widely listed. Both are external events, not work
      items - so this should not sit in the queue as though it were pending.

### 2.18es FEWER MOVING PARTS: split the controller KEY, not the trust model (user, 2026-08-05)

*"is there a way to achieve our goal with less moving parts"* - yes, and it deletes machinery instead
of adding it. **The self-proved path needs six new components and none of them work yet:**

| component | status |
|---|---|
| a canonical subject identifier | **unsolved** - names vary by transliteration (2.18eo); passports cover **23.3%** (2.18eq) |
| an OPRF | needs the identifier it cannot create, and adds an operator who can deny service (2.18er) |
| non-membership circuit | **~529k gates on EVERY withdrawal** (2.18eq) |
| a second tree + document parsing | plus TWO fail-closed mapping tables (country, document type) |
| exclusion-specific root freshness | the asymmetry 2.13e flags |
| **and it still keeps a controller** | for `document.not-current` and its kind - 2.18cu says so itself |

**THE ALTERNATIVE CHANGES ONE THING AND NO CODE.** The envelope is hashed ElGamal on babyJub:
`c1 = G·r`, `shared = PK·r`, `sealed[i] = payload[i] + H(shared, i)`. `seal_payload` takes
`controller_x/y` - **a single public key**. So:

> **Let `PK` be the SUM of n independently-generated keys: `PK = Σ PKᵢ`.** Each holder keeps `skᵢ`.
> To open an envelope each computes `c1·skᵢ` and the points are summed, giving `c1·Σskᵢ = shared`.
> **No party ever holds the decryption key, and no party ever learns it.**

**ZERO CIRCUIT CHANGE. ZERO CONTRACT CHANGE.** `PK` is one curve point whichever way it was formed;
`seal_payload`, `CONTROLLER_KEY_X/Y` and every committed fixture see exactly what they see today. The
change is entirely in how the key is generated and used, which is off-chain.

**AND IT NEEDS NO CEREMONY IN THE DANGEROUS SENSE.** There is no dealer, no Shamir, no Lagrange, no
toxic waste and no interactive DKG - each party generates a keypair, publishes `PKᵢ`, and the points
are added. Re-sharing later invalidates nothing already proven, unlike a SNARK setup.

**THE FAILURE MODE IS THE HARMLESS ONE, BY 2.18cu'S OWN ARGUMENT.** `n`-of-`n` means any holder can
block a revocation - and for a BLACKLIST that fails **OPEN**: someone does not get revoked. 2.18cu
shows that is the safe direction, precisely because inaction shrinks a blacklist. **Contrast the
OPRF, whose operator's silence fails CLOSED and censors a withdrawer** (2.18er). Same "one party can
stall it", opposite consequence.

**WHAT IS HONESTLY GIVEN UP.** This is NOT authority-free: all `n` together can de-anonymise. It
moves the property from *"one party can read anyone"* to *"no party can read anyone alone"*, which is
achievable today at zero code cost - where authority-freeness is, on three measurements, not
achievable at all for this predicate.

**AND THE ANCHORED LISTS ARE NOT WASTED.** They stop being an enforcement mechanism and become an
AUDIT one: a revocation cites the snapshot it rests on, so every use of the authority is attributable
and falsifiable off-chain. That is what 2.18cr correctly refused to let them be a *guard*, kept as a
*record* - the distinction being that nothing pretends to enforce it on-chain.

- [ ] Decide `n` and who holds the shares. **The only real question here**, and it is governance, not
      engineering.
- [ ] Additive `n`-of-`n` first, since it needs no dealer. Move to `t`-of-`n` only if a lost share
      turning off revocation permanently is judged worse than a stalled revocation - note that with a
      blacklist, "revocation stops working" fails open by the same argument.
- [ ] Require `revoke` to cite `(registryId, snapshotIndex)` as EVIDENCE, explicitly not as a check.
      2.18cr rejected citation-as-guard and was right; citation-as-record is a different claim.
- [ ] Say plainly in the docs that the sanctions predicate has an authority. Three measurements say
      the alternative is unavailable, and an unbuilt item implies it is merely pending.

### 2.18er THE OPRF IS NOT THE BLOCKING DEPENDENCY, AND IT CONTRADICTS 2.18cu'S CENTRAL CLAIM (2026-08-05)

Went to build the OPRF, since 2.18cz calls it *"load-bearing rather than optional"* and 2.18eq
confirmed document-binding cannot replace it. **Checked the mechanism first, and two things are
wrong - one about ordering, one a direct contradiction.**

**1. THERE IS A PRIOR DEPENDENCY, AND IT IS THE ONE ACTUALLY BLOCKING.** An OPRF computes
`F(k, x)` such that the holder learns the output and not `k`, and the operator learns nothing about
`x`. That defeats **grindability** - 2.18cz's real argument, that a published `hash(name)` lets anyone
dictionary-attack the register. It does **nothing** about whether the two sides feed it the same `x`.

> `F(k, "IVANOV IVAN")` and `F(k, "IVANOV<<IVAN<<<")` are unrelated values. **The OPRF requires a
> canonical identifier; it does not create one.**

So the chain is **canonical identifier → OPRF → self-proved non-membership**, and 2.18cz names the
second link as the dependency while the first is unbuilt. 2.18eo established names are not canonical
(transliteration and alias ordering both vary, by the workflow's own comment); 2.18eq measured the
only canonical alternative at **23.3%** coverage. **The blocker is the identifier, not the primitive.**

**2. IT CONTRADICTS THE ARGUMENT 2.18cu RESTS ON.** That section's case for self-proved
non-membership is, verbatim:

> *"No controller reads anyone. No matcher runs over the population. **Nobody can be silent, because
> there is nobody whose action is required.**"*

But an OPRF is a **two-party protocol by definition** - the holder blinds `x`, the key holder
evaluates, the holder unblinds. **The key holder's participation is required per evaluation.** They
can refuse, be unavailable, or be compelled. A threshold OPRF distributes that across `t`-of-`n` but
does not remove it.

**AND BY 2.18cu'S OWN POLARITY ARGUMENT THAT IS THE BAD DIRECTION.** It shows a blacklist fails OPEN
when the feed stalls, which is why inaction is harmless. But a holder who cannot obtain an OPRF
evaluation cannot produce a proof at all, so **the OPRF operator's silence fails CLOSED - it censors
the withdrawer.** The design swaps *"a controller who can de-anonymise"* for *"an operator who can
deny service"*, which is a different authority, not no authority.

**WHAT THIS DOES NOT SAY.** The OPRF is not useless - it is the right answer to grindability, and if
a canonical identifier ever exists it should be used. What is wrong is the ORDER and the CLAIM: it is
not the next thing to build, and it does not deliver an authority-free design.

- [ ] **Correct 2.18cu's central claim.** "Nobody whose action is required" is false for any design
      that needs an OPRF. Either the claim narrows to "no controller reads anyone", or the design
      needs a non-interactive alternative.
- [ ] **The real open question: is there a canonical subject identifier at all?** Names are not,
      passports cover 23.3%. If the honest answer is no, then self-proved non-membership over these
      lists is not achievable and the sanctions predicate keeps an authority - which should be
      SAID rather than left as an unbuilt item implying it is merely pending.
- [ ] Only after that: OPRF for grindability, if there is an identifier to blind.

### 2.18eq MEASURED: Poseidon on-chain is dead, keccak in-circuit is fine, and coverage is 27.7% (2026-08-05)

Both numbers 2.18ep said to take before building. One settles a question open since 2.18db; the other
says the design cannot be the whole control.

**1. THE HASH. `test/registry/SanctionsRootHashCost.t.sol`, measured not estimated:**

| | per sorted pair-hash | tree over 17,000 leaves |
|---|---|---|
| keccak | **239 gas** | **4,062,761** (~14% of a block) |
| Poseidon, INLINED | **29,113 gas** | **494,891,887** - **16.5 blocks** |

**Poseidon is 121x keccak on the EVM, and `_computeRoot` hashes the whole leaf set every refresh.**
Even at N=1,000 a Poseidon root costs 29.1M gas - a whole block for a thousand names. **So 2.18db's
option "anchor publishes a Poseidon root too" is DEAD**, and so is "switch the registry to Poseidon".
(2.18db's own 32,549 figure was for a DELEGATECALL; inlining saves 12% and changes nothing.)

**AND THE REMAINING OPTION IS THE CHEAP ONE, which is why this is a resolution rather than a
setback.** The in-circuit cost of keccak is derivable from today's tree measurements: the leaf circuit
hashes 448 bytes (4 keccak blocks) at 1,544,632 gates and the internal node hashes 64 bytes (1 block)
at 1,487,966, so **at most ~18,900 gates per keccak block** - and that is an upper bound, since the
leaf also carries 12 more public inputs.

| bracketing proof | hashes | gates |
|---|---|---|
| N=1,000 (depth 10) | 20 | ~378k |
| **N=17,000 (depth 14)** | 28 | **~529k** |
| N=100,000 (depth 17) | 34 | ~642k |

Against **~798,000 gates for a single in-circuit UltraHonk verification**, a full bracketing proof
costs less than two thirds of one recursion. **The circuit can pay keccak comfortably. Keep keccak on
both sides; there is no seam to resolve.**

**2. THE COVERAGE, and it is the number that matters.** Parsed the real OFAC SDN export
(`SDN.XML`, 28.8 MB, 19,178 rows):

| | count | |
|---|---|---|
| individuals | **7,473** | entities 9,839 · vessels 1,524 · aircraft 342 |
| with ANY id record | 6,919 | 92.6% |
| **with a PASSPORT id** | **2,069** | **27.7%** |

Other id types are numerous - National ID 1,368, C.U.R.P. 599, Tax ID 543, Cedula 492 - but **none is
in an ICAO MRZ**, so none is matchable from the document our registration actually proves.

> **⚠️ 27.7% MEANS DOCUMENT-BINDING CANNOT BE THE SANCTIONS CONTROL.** Roughly seven in ten listed
> individuals publish no passport number, so a check built on it clears them. It is SOUND - a listed
> passport always matches, and country+number is unique - but it is nowhere near complete, and
> describing it as "we screen against OFAC" would be false.

**WHAT THAT LEAVES.** Document-binding is a cheap, exact, trustless component that removes the
controller **for the cases it covers**, and it is worth having on those grounds. It does not retire
the OPRF, which 2.18cu named as the dependency for the other ~72%. **2.18ep's claim that it
"supersedes the OPRF dependency for this predicate" is withdrawn on the measurement.**

- [x] ~~Decide whether a sound-but-27.7% check is worth shipping.~~ **NO, on the full measurement:
      23.3% across all three sources, and the UN's document TYPE field is itself localised.** Not
      built. Revisit only as a free rider on the OPRF.
- [ ] If shipped, the claim must be stated exactly: *"not listed under a published passport number"*,
      never "not sanctioned".
- [x] **Re-take coverage against UN and OFSI.** **DONE - and it is worse, not better:**

| source | individuals | with a passport | |
|---|---|---|---|
| OFAC SDN | 7,473 | 2,069 | 27.7% |
| UN SC consolidated | 736 | 260 | 35.3% |
| UK OFSI consolidated | 13,863 | 2,803 | **20.2%** |
| **all three** | **22,072** | **5,132** | **23.3%** |

OFSI is the LARGEST individual list and has the WORST coverage, so weighting by size pulls the
figure DOWN to 23.3%. **More than three quarters of listed individuals publish no passport number.**

**AND THE UN DATA CARRIES THE EXACT FUZZINESS THE REPO OWNER RULED OUT.** Its
`TYPE_OF_DOCUMENT` field is LOCALISED - `Passport` (350), `Numéro de passeport` (3), `Número de
pasaporte` (3) - and 434 of 736 individual documents carry an EMPTY type. So even deciding *"is this
row a passport"* needs a mapping over an open set of strings, before any number is compared. That is
the same open-set problem that killed name-binding, reappearing one field earlier.

**VERDICT: document-binding is not worth building as a sanctions control.** It is sound, cheap and
trustless, and it covers under a quarter of the population while requiring a fail-closed mapping for
the document TYPE as well as the country. The OPRF (2.18cu) remains the dependency, and this should
be revisited only if it can ride along at near-zero cost once that exists.

### 2.18ep BIND ON THE DOCUMENT NUMBER, NOT THE NAME - simpler, cheaper, and removes the controller (user, 2026-08-05)

*"there may be some way to simplify this while increasing the efficiency and trustlessness of it"* -
there is, and it drops the two things that made 2.18eo impossible.

**THE OBSERVATION.** A name is not canonical. A **passport number is**, and it is in the MRZ at a
fixed offset. And the sanctions sources publish it: OFAC's SDN XML carries an `idList` of
`{idType, idNumber, idCountry}` with real rows like `idType: "passport", idNumber: "j287011",
idCountry: "colombia"`. **Our parser simply never reads them** - `sources.go` extracts
`ReferenceField` and `NameFields` and nothing else.

**THE PROPOSAL.** Emit a SECOND tree per source, keyed on the document rather than the listing:

```
leaf = keccak( normalizedCountry ‖ normalizedNumber )     for rows where idType == passport
```

A holder then proves NON-membership by bracketing two adjacent leaves - and
`RegistrySourceAnchor._computeRoot` **already enforces strictly-ascending leaves**
(`LeavesNotStrictlySorted`), so the anchored structure supports bracketing today with no change.

**WHY IT IS BETTER ON ALL THREE AXES, not a trade:**

| | name-binding (2.18eo) | document-binding |
|---|---|---|
| preimage available to the holder | **no** - leaf commits to the publisher's `Reference` | **yes** - country + number are both in the MRZ |
| canonicalisation needed | unbounded: transliteration, alias order, arity | **bounded**: ~250 ICAO country codes + uppercase/strip |
| circuit cost | hash a variable-arity name set | **one keccak of ~20 bytes** |
| who learns the identity | the CONTROLLER, by opening an envelope | **nobody** |
| needs an OPRF | yes, as a dependency (2.18cu) | **no** |

**THE TRUSTLESSNESS GAIN IS THE POINT.** The holder proves their own non-membership from their own
document. No envelope is opened, no matcher runs, nobody is told who anyone is - which is what
2.18cr identified as the blocker on evidence-bound revocation, and what the OPRF was being brought in
to solve.

**⚠️ WHAT IT DOES NOT CLAIM, and this must be stated wherever it is used.** It only catches listed
subjects **whose passport is published**. Not every SDN row has a document number, so this is a
NARROWER claim than a name match would be. It is however SOUND - it never clears someone whose listed
passport matches - whereas fuzzy name matching is neither sound nor complete. **A narrower claim
honestly labelled beats a broader one that cannot be made.**

**NO FUZZINESS ANYWHERE - the repo owner's constraint, and it rules out my first version.** I proposed
normalising `idCountry` ("colombia") to an ICAO code and stripping punctuation from `idNumber`. Both
are guesses wearing the word "normalisation", and a guess on a sanctions check is the error-prone
thing. **Three rules replace them:**

**1. THE COUNTRY MAP IS ENUMERATED AND FAIL-CLOSED, never inferred.** A pinned table maps each
source's published country string to ISO 3166 alpha-3. **An unmapped string fails the WORKFLOW** - it
does not get guessed, and it does not get silently dropped, because a dropped row is a sanctioned
person who becomes withdrawable. The table's hash is anchored beside the root, so a change is visible
rather than ambient.

**2. THE NUMBER IS MATCHED EXACTLY, and variants are emitted as SEPARATE LEAVES.** No stripping. If a
source publishes a number in more than one form, the workflow emits a leaf for each form as
published, plus its uppercase form. More leaves is cheap; a lossy transform is not, because two
distinct numbers collapsing to one string is a false hit and one number failing to collapse is a
MISS.

**3. EVERY AMBIGUITY RESOLVES TOWARD EXCLUSION.** On a blacklist the two errors are not symmetric: a
miss admits a sanctioned person, a false hit inconveniences an innocent one who can be handled out of
band. So anything the workflow cannot resolve exactly becomes a leaf (blocking), never an omission.

**AND THE HASH IS DECIDED BY THIS, which 2.18db left open pending exactly such a consumer.** That
section lists three options and asks for measurement. The document tree has ONE consumer - a circuit -
so it should be **Poseidon**, while the existing name/reference tree keeps **keccak** because its
consumer is Solidity and on-chain data availability. Two trees, two hashes, each matched to its
reader. The cost 2.18db warns about - Poseidon over thousands of leaves on-chain at 32,549 gas per
hash - is the thing to measure before committing, and it may be what decides the whole shape.

**⚠️ AND A REFRESHABLE "CLEAN" ATTESTATION IS NOT AVAILABLE, so this must be per-withdrawal.** I was
going to propose proving non-membership once and caching it in the registry. `statusOf` is
**MONOTONE** by deliberate design - *"moves 0 -> predicate once and never back"* - so there is no
un-revoke and no refresh. The expensive proof therefore sits on the withdrawal path, which makes the
Poseidon question above load-bearing rather than cosmetic.

- [x] **Measure coverage.** **DONE (2.18eq): 27.7%** of OFAC SDN individuals publish a passport
      number. Too low to be the whole control.
- [ ] Extend `sources.go` to parse `idList` (OFAC), the UN's `INDIVIDUAL_DOCUMENT`, and OFSI's
      passport fields, and emit the document tree alongside the existing one under its own
      `registryId`.
- [ ] Build the country map as an ENUMERATED table with an unmapped-string FAILURE, and anchor its
      hash beside the root. No inference, no defaults.
- [ ] Emit number variants as separate leaves rather than normalising, and pin the exact-match rule
      with a Go/Noir differential test - the same two-implementations-must-agree hazard as
      `BatchCommitmentLib` (2.18ec), so a construction rather than a frozen constant.
- [x] **Measure Poseidon-over-N-leaves on-chain.** **DONE (2.18eq): 494M gas at N=17,000, 121x
      keccak.** Poseidon is dead on-chain; keccak costs ~529k gates in-circuit, which is affordable.
      **Keep keccak on both sides.**
- [ ] Then the non-membership circuit: extract issuing state + document number from the MRZ at their
      ICAO offsets (`query_identity` already does selective MRZ disclosure), hash, and bracket
      against the anchored root.
- [x] ~~Supersedes the OPRF dependency.~~ **WITHDRAWN on the measurement**: at 27.7% coverage the
      OPRF is still needed for the other ~72%.

### 2.18eo THE NAME-BINDING CIRCUIT CANNOT BE BUILT AGAINST THESE LEAVES - and the reason is in our own code (2026-08-05)

Asked to build it, since 2.18cw says land the proofs first and 2.18cr calls it *"the highest-leverage
unbuilt item in this area"*. **Checked the mechanism before building around it, and it does not hold -
for two independent reasons, both stated by the code that produces the leaves.**

The circuit is specified as: prove `hash(document name fields) == leaf` for a leaf in an anchored
registry root. Here is what a sanctions leaf actually commits to (`sanctions_lists/sources.go:605`):

```
leafHash = keccak( keccak(registryKey) ‖ keccak(Reference) ‖ keccak(Kind)
                   ‖ uint32(len(NameParts)) ‖ keccak(NameParts[0]) ‖ ... )
```

**1. THE LEAF COMMITS TO `Reference`, WHICH NO PASSPORT CONTAINS.** It is *"the source's OWN
identifier for the listing, as published"* - an OFAC/UN/OFSI listing number. A holder cannot compute
their own leaf from their own document under any name scheme, because a required preimage component
is a value only the publisher assigns. **This alone is fatal**, independent of names.

**2. NAMES ARE NOT CANONICAL, AND THE CODE SAYS SO IN THE SAME COMMENT:** *"a name is not stable at
all (transliteration and alias ordering both vary)"*, and `NameParts` are stored *"IN ITS OWN ORDER
AND ARITY, uncombined"* because *"joining is what makes a leaf ambiguous"*. There is **no name
canonicalisation anywhere in the sanctions workflow** - the only `normalize` in the family is
`normalizeStatus` in the NOTARY workflow, and it normalises a status string, not a name. An ICAO MRZ
carries one Latin transliteration (Doc 9303); OFAC carries its own. Equality of
`keccak(name_part)` between the two is not a thing that happens.

**AND FUZZY MATCHING IS NOT AN ESCAPE.** `hash(x) == leaf` is exact by construction. A circuit that
approximated a name match would be constraining the wrong half - the false-safety shape standing rule
3 refuses, and precisely the shape 2.18cr already rejected for the citation-only version of `revoke`.

**WHY THE TODO ALREADY CONTAINS THE ANSWER.** 2.18cu lists *"treat the OPRF as a DEPENDENCY of
self-proved non-membership, not a separate nicety"*. That is exactly this problem: an OPRF gives both
sides a canonical, blinded identifier derived the same way, which is what a name cannot be. **The
name-binding circuit is downstream of the OPRF, not parallel to it** - and 2.18cr's "one circuit
unblocks three paths" is true only once a canonical identifier exists to bind.

**THE NOTARY CASE IS DIFFERENT AND MAY STILL BE BUILDABLE**, which is worth separating rather than
lumping. `notary_registry/registry.go:122` gives
`leaf = keccak(keccak(License) ‖ keccak(FullName) ‖ keccak(Region) ‖ keccak(normalizeStatus(Info)))`.
Every component except `FullName` is something a notary KNOWS - licence number, region, status - so
the missing piece there is only the name representation, not an unavailable publisher identifier.
That is a smaller problem than the sanctions one and should be assessed on its own.

- [ ] **Do the OPRF first.** It is the dependency, not an enhancement, and nothing downstream of a
      canonical identifier can be built until it exists.
- [ ] **Assess the NOTARY name-binding separately** - its leaf lacks the fatal `Reference` component,
      so the only question there is whether a Ukrainian register's `FullName` can be reconciled with
      an MRZ, or whether the licence number alone should be the binding instead.
- [ ] **Do NOT build sanctions name-binding as specified.** If it is wanted anyway, the CRE workflow
      must first emit a SECOND index keyed on a canonical identifier - and what that identifier is,
      is the OPRF question.

### 2.18en THE POSTMAN ROLE IS GONE - and 2.18cp's preferred option does not exist (2026-08-05)

**THE BLOCKING DECISION IN 2.18cl RESOLVES ITSELF ON A FACT, not a trade.** It asked whether to
verify DON signatures in-contract or accept the Forwarder as the relay, and 2.18cp called the first
*"the STRONGER option, and the only one that removes the key rather than relocating it"*.

> **The signatures never arrive.** `onReport(bytes metadata, bytes report)` is the entire surface,
> and `metadata` is a fixed **109-byte** header - version, executionId, timestamp, donId,
> donConfigVersion, workflowId, workflowName, workflowOwner, reportId - already confirmed against
> `cre-sdk-go v1.15.0`. There is no room for a signature set anywhere in it. **The Forwarder verifies
> the DON quorum and then calls this.** A contract cannot check what it is not given.

So 2.18cp preferred something this interface does not offer.

**⚠️ I THEN RETRACTED A CORRECT CLAIM, WHICH IS THE WORSE ERROR.** Told I had over-ascribed, I
searched THIS REPOSITORY for a Forwarder, found none, and concluded the claim was unsupported and the
address "might be a plain EOA". The repo was the wrong place to look. **Read the docs instead**
(docs.chain.link/cre), and the original claim was right:

| | per Chainlink's docs |
|---|---|
| what it is | **`KeystoneForwarder`, a Chainlink-managed CONTRACT**, deployed per network |
| what it does | *"validates the report's signatures"* - the DON signature check happens THERE, before our call |
| the address | published per-network in the **Forwarder Directory**; `cre workflow supported-chains` lists them |
| the interface | `IReceiver is IERC165` with `onReport(bytes,bytes) external` - **returning nothing** |
| Chainlink's own base | `ReceiverTemplate` checks forwarder address (required), workflow ID, workflow owner, workflow name (only with owner, guarding a 40-bit collision) |

**So gating on the Forwarder address IS meaningful** - it is delegation to a documented signature
check, not to an unknown key. What I should have done at the first challenge is read the docs, not
grep our own tree and then hedge in the opposite direction.

**THREE CONCRETE PROBLEMS THIS SURFACES, none of them speculative:**

1. **⚠️ WRITE-ONCE IS WRONG, AND THE DOCS SAY SO OUTRIGHT:** *"Update the address when deploying from
   simulation to production, as they differ between environments."* A one-time setter makes the
   documented simulation-to-production path impossible without a contract upgrade, and would also
   strand us if Chainlink ever redeploys. **This is a defect in what I built, not a trade-off.**
2. **We implement neither `IReceiver` nor `IERC165`.** The selector still dispatches, so a call would
   work, but `IReceiver` extends `IERC165` - if the Forwarder or the tooling checks
   `supportsInterface`, our contract is not a valid receiver.
3. **Our `onReport` returns `(uint256, bytes32)`; the interface returns nothing.** Harmless to a
   caller that ignores returndata, but it means we are not interface-conformant and cannot simply
   declare `is IReceiver`.

**WHAT WE DO THAT `ReceiverTemplate` WOULD NOT.** We pin the full 32-byte workflow ID, which is
strictly stronger than its optional name check - the docs flag name-only validation as vulnerable to
a 40-bit collision. That part of the design stands.

**WHAT WAS DONE INSTEAD, and it removes the human key anyway.** `REGISTRY_POSTMAN` is deleted.
Publication is gated on `forwarder`, an **ADDRESS set once**:

| | grantable role | write-once address |
|---|---|---|
| guarantee | "the operator granted it to the Forwarder and will not grant it again" | one address, chosen once |
| can it be re-pointed | yes, silently, by any admin | **no** - `ForwarderAlreadySet` |
| can a person hold it | yes | only if deliberately set to one, once, visibly |

**Splitting it off `NOTARY_REGISTRAR` (2.18cn) was necessary and not sufficient.** Even alone the
role was grantable, so its security rested on an operator remembering. An address that cannot be
moved removes the key rather than documenting how to hold it.

**Three tests make it a property of the code**: the forwarder cannot be changed once set, not even
by the owner, and a non-forwarder caller is refused by name (`NotForwarder(caller)`) rather than as a
generic access-control error, so a misconfigured address is diagnosable.

`test_aPublicationOnlyHolderCannotTouchTheNotarySet` had to move to a FRESH anchor - the suite's
`postman` deliberately holds both powers, so after the change it was comparing an address with
itself. Write-once means a publication-only address only exists on an anchor that has none yet,
which is also the real deployment shape.

476 tests pass, ABI check green.

- [ ] **UNDO WRITE-ONCE.** It blocks the documented simulation-to-production migration. Make it
      owner-settable with an activation delay - the same shape `pinWorkflow` already uses, so a swap
      is visible and contestable before it takes effect, rather than either silently repointable or
      permanently frozen.
- [ ] **Implement `IReceiver` and `IERC165`.** `IReceiver is IERC165`, so `supportsInterface` may be
      checked; and conforming means dropping `onReport`'s return values, which nothing on-chain reads
      anyway - the tests read the emitted events.
- [ ] Take the forwarder address from the Forwarder Directory for the target network rather than
      inventing one, and record WHICH network's address is set.
- [ ] **Set the Forwarder at deployment.** A one-time step with no default; an anchor without it
      accepts no reports at all, which is the right failure but must be in the deployment sequence
      rather than remembered.
- [ ] 2.18cm's "replace REGISTRY_POSTMAN with quid's write-once forwarder address" is DONE in
      substance. Its remaining question - whether a pre-Forwarder bootstrap is needed - is answered
      NO: the anchor simply publishes nothing until the address is set.

### 2.18em CHONK RETIRED - and the one thing worth keeping from it (2026-08-05)

Deleted: `withdraw_ivc_{app,kernel_init,kernel_inner,hiding,wrapper}`, `pp/src/ivc.nr`,
`fold-withdrawals.py`, `vk_hash/`, `ChonkRootHonkVerifier.sol`, `chonk_root.json`,
`ChonkRootProofOnChain.t.sol`. `pp` 87/87, forge 478/478, and the tree still builds.

**⚠️ THE FINDING THE DELETED CIRCUITS PROVED, recorded because nothing else now demonstrates it.**
A ClientIVC/chonk proof CAN be verified on Ethereum. The hop is not a missing precompile, it is a
PROOF TYPE: `PROOF_TYPE_ROLLUP_HONK = 4` ACCUMULATES the child's IPA claim and leaves it nested, so
`-t evm` refuses it; **`PROOF_TYPE_ROOT_ROLLUP_HONK = 5` DISCHARGES it**, verifying the inner product
argument natively in-circuit and leaving an ordinary UltraHonk proof a Solidity verifier accepts. The
same circuit costs 1.7 GB at type 4 and 7.1 GB at type 5 - that gap IS the discharge. bb refuses a
single-child root (`Root rollup must accumulate two IPA proofs`), and the whole chain was measured
end to end: 16 withdrawals -> fold (572 MB) -> wrapper (1.9 GB) -> root (6.77 GB) -> 6/6 on-chain
tests. **If chonk is ever revisited, that is the map.**

**WHY IT LOST ANYWAY.** A hard ceiling of **25 per fold** (op-queue, bisected: 25 proves, 26 fails),
so 50 per settlement at best. The tree has no ceiling, runs at 2.11 GB against 6.77, and past a batch
of 32 is cheaper per withdrawal too.

**WHAT WAS KEPT AND WHY.**
- `tools/build-fold-witnesses.js` - the tree's own leaves come from it. Renamed nothing; it was never
  chonk-specific, it builds N distinct withdrawals against ONE state tree.
- The witnesses moved to `backend/circuits/batch-witnesses/`. They had been living inside the chonk
  app's package, which made them look like its property **and broke the tree the moment that package
  was deleted** - caught immediately, but it is the kind of coupling that is invisible until removal.
- `pp::withdraw::verify_withdrawal` - the shared statement, untouched.

**WHAT WENT WITH IT, found by control-checked greps rather than assumed.** `vk_hash/` existed only
for chonk's empty `key_hash` (bb emits one for ultra_honk), referenced by 0 files against a control
of 7 for `build-recursion-tree`. And `pp`'s `keccak256` dependency died with `ivc.nr`: 0 files in
`pp/src` use keccak, against a control of 8 that use poseidon.

- [x] **Retire the flat aggregator.** **DONE**: circuit, verifier, fixture and test deleted. The
      pool's slot is `BATCH_VERIFIER` now, not `AGGREGATION_VERIFIER` - it holds a
      `TreeRoot<N>HonkVerifier` and the depths are not interchangeable, so the address is what says
      which batch size a pool settles. `foundry.toml`'s optimizer restriction became a glob over
      `TreeRoot*HonkVerifier.sol`, which also brought all three depths to 17,744 bytes / 6,832 margin.

### 2.18el DECIDED: the tree settles, chonk is retired - and nobody waits for 16 (user, 2026-08-05)

Repo owner: *"go with the tree, retire chonk."* Recorded as the decision. What follows is the state
it has to be handed over in.

**"IS IT STILL 16 PER BATCH?" - TODAY YES, BY DESIGN NO, AND THE GAP IS PADDING.**
`build-recursion-tree.py` demands a power of two and builds exactly N real leaves, and the deployed
verifier is depth 4. So right now it is 16 or nothing. That is a builder limitation, not a property
of the design.

**THE COST DOES NOT DEPEND ON HOW FULL THE BATCH IS.** A tree of 16 verifies for **2,776,678 gas
whether it holds 2 real withdrawals or 16**, because the root proof is one fixed-size UltraHonk proof
with one public input. So a batch can settle EARLY and split:

| in batch | gas each | @15 gwei | @30 gwei | @60 gwei |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| solo (no batch) | 2,528,007 | $114 | **$228** | $455 |
| 2 | 1,388,339 | $62 | $125 | $250 |
| 4 | 694,169 | $31 | $62 | $125 |
| 8 | 347,084 | $16 | $31 | $62 |
| 16 | 173,542 | $8 | **$16** | $31 |

*(ETH at $3,000; the ratios are what matter, not the dollar figures.)*

> **TWO people batching already beats going alone.** So the answer to "wait for 16 or pay $200" is
> neither: settle with whoever is there. Waiting only makes it cheaper, and the curve is steepest at
> the start - the 2nd person halves it, the 16th shaves $2.

**WHAT PADDING NEEDS, and the trap in it.** Empty slots need a canonical zero-value withdrawal proof,
made once and reused. **Reusing one proof means reusing its NULLIFIER**, so the settlement half must
skip padding entries BEFORE the duplicate-nullifier check - otherwise the second padded slot in any
batch is rejected as a double-spend. Skipping by `withdrawn_value == 0` leaks how many slots were
padding, which is fine: batch occupancy is public from the calldata anyway.

- [x] **Padding.** **DONE (`5f88de9`)**: any N pads to the next power of two, settlement skips
      `withdrawn_value == 0` before `_spend` and before the context check, and a 5-in-8 batch was
      proved and its root reproduced on-chain. Each padding slot has its OWN note, so nullifiers stay
      distinct.
- [x] **Deploy several depths (16/32/64) rather than one.** With padding, a batch settles at the  **DONE (`c6d0dd5` + `5f88de9`)**: TreeRoot8/16/32 deployed, padding lets a batch pick the smallest that fits.
      smallest tree that fits it, so a quiet hour costs a depth-4 verification and a busy one costs a
      depth-6. One verifier per depth, deployed once.
- [x] **Retire chonk.** **DONE (`fad1f39`)**, IPA finding recorded first. `vk_hash` went too - it
      was generic but referenced by nothing.

### 2.18ek THE FOLD CEILING IS 25, AND IT IS THE FOLD'S ALONE - the tree has none (user, 2026-08-05)

**Bisected, not reasoned. N=25 proves; N=26 fails.** Two distinct limits were hit on the way and the
tighter one wins:

| N | result |
|---|---|
| 16, 20, 24, **25** | proof, 1,223 fields every time |
| **26** | `Merged table size exceeds fixed append offset... the last subtable doesn't fit at the end of the op queue` |
| 32 | `BatchMergeProver: more subtables than max_subtables` (64 > 56) |

The subtable-count cap implies N<=28; the op-queue cap bites first at 26. Ultra ops grow ~148 per
withdrawal (3,235 at N=20, 3,827 at N=24, 3,975 at N=25), so **the real ceiling depends on our
circuits' size, not on a universal constant** - a smaller app circuit would raise it.

**⚠️ THIS LIMIT IS CHONK'S. THE TREE DOES NOT HAVE IT.** They are unrelated mechanisms: the ceiling is
the Goblin op queue inside ClientIVC, and the recursion tree is plain UltraHonk recursion. Conflating
them - "24 works, so can we do tree at 24" - is natural and wrong in a way that matters, because it
makes the tree look constrained when it is the one that is not.

**AND THE TREE SCALES ON GAS EXACTLY AS THE FOLD DOES.** Its root proof is **334 fields with ONE
public input at every depth** (measured at N=4 and N=16), so verification gas is FIXED per settlement
and per-withdrawal cost halves each time the batch doubles - the same property the fold has, without
the ceiling:

| batch | nodes | per-withdrawal gas | peak | sequential |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| tree 16 | 15 | 173,542 | **2.11 GB** | ~4 min |
| tree 32 | 31 | 86,771 | **2.11 GB** | ~9 min |
| **tree 64** | 63 | **43,385** | **2.11 GB** | ~18 min |
| tree 128 | 127 | 21,692 | **2.11 GB** | ~38 min |
| fold+root 32 | - | 90,717 | 6.77 GB | ~5 min |
| **fold+root 50 (the cap)** | - | **58,059** | 6.77 GB | ~5 min |

> **Past a batch of 32 the tree beats the fold on gas, at a third of the peak memory, with no
> ceiling at all.** The fold's best possible number - 50 withdrawals, 58,059 each - is worse than a
> tree of 64.

**SO THE FOLD'S REMAINING ADVANTAGES ARE TWO, AND BOTH ARE REAL BUT NARROW:**
1. **Batch size is not baked into a deployed verifier.** A deeper tree needs one more level circuit
   AND a newly deployed root verifier; the fold takes any N<=25 against the same deployment.
2. **Time.** ~5 minutes against ~18 for a tree of 64, sequentially. The tree's levels are
   independent, so with parallelism its critical path is ~6x18s, but that needs the cores.

**AND THE TREE'S COST IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS FOR A BATCHER:** 2.11 GB is a laptop, 6.77 GB is not.
Combined with 2.18dp's raid-target concern, a settlement path many parties can run beats one that is
3x cheaper per withdrawal only up to a batch of 32.

- [x] ~~Build a tree at 32~~ **DONE (`c6d0dd5`)**: depth 5 gives 334 fields and one public input,
      identical to depth 4, at 2.19 GB. The flat-gas claim holds and is now pinned by
      `test_theRootShapeDoesNotGrowWithDepth`.
- [ ] Build a tree at 64 if a batch that size is ever wanted. Depths 3, 4 and 5 all give the same
      root shape, so depth 6 is expected to as well - this is confirmation, not discovery.
- [x] If the tree wins, the batch size becomes a DEPLOYMENT decision - one root verifier per depth.  **DONE (`c6d0dd5`)**: the verifier name carries N; 8/16/32 exist and are tested.
      Decide whether to deploy several depths at once (16/32/64) so a batch can settle at whatever
      size it reached, rather than waiting to fill a fixed one.

### 2.18ej HOW I WOULD CHANGE THE DESIGN - stop treating 16 as the batch size (user, 2026-08-05)

**THE ROOT'S COST IS PER-SETTLEMENT, NOT PER-WITHDRAWAL, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE LEVER.** 6.77 GB and
~2.9M gas buy one settlement whatever it contains. The fold is constant-size in N - 1,223 proof
fields at N=4 and N=16 alike, measured - so the way to pay less per withdrawal is simply to fold more
of them.

**⚠️ THE TABLE THAT WAS HERE PROJECTED 128/256/512 WITHDRAWALS PER SETTLEMENT AND WAS WRONG** - see
the ceiling below. The real range is 32 today to **56 at the cap**, which is 90,717 down to 51,838
per withdrawal against 186,255 flat and 173,542 tree. Still the cheapest path, by ~3.3x rather than
the ~8x claimed.

Raising the batch within that range costs nothing - no new levels, no new verifier, no
redeployment - and a bigger batch is a bigger anonymity set, so cost and privacy still pull the same
way. They just stop pulling at 56.

**⚠️ "ANY N" IS FALSE. THERE IS A HARD CEILING AT N=28, AND I ASSERTED OTHERWISE TWICE.**

Measured, not reasoned. `bb prove -s chonk` on a 32-withdrawal stack:

```
Assertion failed: (N <= M)
  Left: 64   Right: 56
  Reason: BatchMergeProver: more subtables than max_subtables
```

A fold of N is `N apps + N kernels + 1 hiding` = **2N+1 circuits**, giving 2N subtables. The cap is
**56**, compiled in as `NUM_SUBTABLES` with **no flag to raise it** - checked `prove --help-extended`
and the binary's strings. So:

> **max N per fold = 28. Two folds per root. 56 withdrawals per on-chain settlement, full stop.**

**WHAT THIS KILLS.** The table below that projected 128, 256 and 512 withdrawals per settlement was
arithmetic on a capability that does not exist. The floor is:

| withdrawals settled | per-withdrawal gas | |
|---|---|---|
| 32 (two folds of 16) | 90,717 | measured today |
| **56 (two folds of 28)** | **51,838** | **the actual floor** |
| ~~128~~ | ~~22,679~~ | **impossible** |

51,838 still beats the tree's 173,542 and flat's 186,255 by ~3.3x, so the fold path is still the
cheapest per withdrawal - but by three times, not eight.

**WHAT SURVIVES.** Constant PROOF SIZE is genuinely enforced: `withdraw_ivc_wrapper` pins
`CHONK_PROOF_LENGTH = 1221`, so a longer proof is rejected as a length mismatch. And peak memory IS
flat - the N=32 stack built at **225 MB** and its prove reached 673 MB before hitting the cap, both
in line with N=16's 572 MB. Memory was never the constraint. **The constraint is a subtable count
nobody had looked for, and I should have found it by measuring rather than by asserting "any N".**

**THE SECOND CHANGE: TREAT THE ROOT AS A MERGE POINT, NOT A BATCHER.** The expensive step needs two
children, and each child is an independent fold at **572 MB**. So the two folds can come from two
DIFFERENT parties who never coordinate beyond agreeing a state root, and either of them (or a third)
does the root. **The cheap step is the frequent one and the expensive step is the rare one** - which
directly answers 2.18dp's "the batcher is a single point of failure that becomes a raid target":
folding is something many people can afford to do, and only the merge is heavy.

**WHAT I WOULD RETIRE.** The flat aggregator is beaten on every axis by both survivors and its only
remaining role is historical - it should go. The recursion tree is the harder call: its one advantage
is a 2.11 GB peak against 6.77 GB, and it buys that by fixing a ceiling on N and wasting padding on
small batches (a batch of 5 in a depth-4 tree pays the full 2.78M gas, ~555k each). **Keep it only if
a genuinely low-memory settlement path is needed; otherwise it is a third thing to keep correct.**

**WHAT MUST HAPPEN FIRST, and it is the real blocker.** `BatchCommitmentLib` still folds flat keccak
while the fold commits by chained `absorb` and the tree by tree-hash. **Neither path can actually
SETTLE on-chain today - both only VERIFY.** Any design discussion downstream of that is premature.

- [x] **Measure peak RSS at larger N.** Not a capability check - the wrapper's pinned proof length  **OBSOLETE**: chonk is retired (2.18em).
      already guarantees the shape - just the memory curve, so a batch size can be chosen on
      evidence rather than caution.
- [x] **Move `BatchCommitmentLib` to the chained `absorb` commitment and check `count`.** This is the  **OBSOLETE**: chonk is retired (2.18em).
      gap between "the chain verifies our proof" and "the chain settles our withdrawals".
- [x] Decide whether two independent folders feeding one root is the operating model. If it is, the  **OBSOLETE**: chonk is retired (2.18em).
      fold generator needs to stop assuming one party builds the whole state tree.

### 2.18ei THE ROOT'S 8.87 GB, SWEPT - 24% off, and ZK is not the reason (user, 2026-08-05)

*"can we improve the 8gb at root situation in any way at all"* - yes, by about a quarter, and the
lever is one flag. Everything below is measured on the same witness and key.

**WHERE THE 8.87 GB COMES FROM:** the root circuit is **8,388,352 gates (2^23)**. Two rollup
verifications are only ~1.5M of that; the rest is the IPA discharge, which is the thing that makes
the proof EVM-verifiable at all. It is not incidental cost, it is the feature.

| run | peak RSS | wall | proof |
|---|---|---|---|
| baseline (`-t evm`) | **8.87 GB** | 100 s | 358 fields |
| **`--slow_low_memory`** | **6.77 GB** | 158 s | 358 fields |
| `--slow_low_memory --storage_budget 24g` | 7.08 GB | 146 s | 358 fields |
| `-t evm-no-zk --slow_low_memory` | **7.44 GB** | 172 s | 320 fields |

**`--slow_low_memory` IS THE WIN: -24% for +58% time.** `--storage_budget` did nothing here - within
noise of the flag alone, so file-backed paging is evidently already doing what it can.

**AND DROPPING ZK MAKES IT WORSE, which is the opposite of the intuition.** 7.44 GB against 6.77, and
slower. So there is no memory argument for a non-ZK root.

**ZK COSTS NO TRUST AND NO WEIGHT HERE.** Honk's zero-knowledge is masking polynomials; it does not
touch the SRS. The trusted setup that exists - the KZG/ignition CRS in `~/.bb-crs` - is **universal
and pre-existing**, one ceremony for every circuit rather than Groth16's per-circuit ceremony, and it
is identical with ZK on or off. Turning ZK off removes nothing from the trust model and buys only
**38 proof fields** (358 -> 320) of calldata, at more memory and more time. **Keep ZK.**

**WHAT CANNOT BE REDUCED, checked rather than assumed:**
- The wrapper cannot be skipped. A root verifying chonk proofs directly (type 8) fails at EVM target
  with `TripleIPA openings present when not expected` - chonk verification needs the rollup IO, so
  the wrapper hop is structural.
- The root cannot take ONE child: `Root rollup must accumulate two IPA proofs`.
- Both children need discharging regardless, so pairing a real fold with a trivial one saves nothing.

- [x] Make `--slow_low_memory` the default for the root step once it is scripted, and record the  **OBSOLETE**: chonk is retired (2.18em).
      time cost next to it so nobody "optimises" it back out.
- [x] 6.77 GB still exceeds what a phone or small VM can do, and the container+swap path SHIFTS that  **OBSOLETE**: chonk is retired (2.18em).
      cost rather than removing it. If the root has to run somewhere constrained, that is a hosting
      decision, not a further tuning one.

### 2.18eh 5.1.0 DELETED - one pin, in one file, for host and container (user, 2026-08-05)

*"if it has no more references delete it."* Done. **Nothing in this tree references bb 5.1.0 any
more**, and every committed proof and verifier was regenerated on 6.0 first, so this is a removal and
not a rename.

| was | now |
|---|---|
| `codegen-verifiers.sh` `REQUIRED_BB="5.1.0"` + `ALSO_ACCEPTED_BB` | `REQUIRED_BB="6.0.0-nightly.20260804"`, single value |
| `codegen-passport-verifiers.sh` same pair | same, single value |
| `passport-verifiers.Dockerfile` `ARG BB_VERSION=5.1.0`, downloads bb | **ships no bb at all**; pins only nargo |
| image `ibiza-passport-verifiers:beta26-bb5.1.0` | `:beta26` - no bb in the tag because none is baked in |
| `build-recursion-tree.py` default `~/.bb/bb` | `node_modules/.bin/bb` |
| `fold-withdrawals.py` BB required, no default | same default |
| README / CLAUDE.md / TODO env table | npm install + `node_modules/.bin` on PATH |

**THE CONTAINER TAKES bb FROM THE MOUNTED REPO.** The npm package ships a native
`build/amd64-linux/bb`; the runner symlinks it onto PATH inside the container. Verified: the image
has `nargo 1.0.0-beta.26`, `command -v bb` resolves to the symlink, `bb --version` is
`6.0.0-nightly.20260804`, and `/usr/local/bin/bb` does not exist.

**WHY THAT IS BETTER THAN PINNING IT TWICE.** A version baked into the image can silently disagree
with the host's, and the image tag then has to carry a version that can go stale on its own. One pin
in `package.json` covers both, and a bb bump is `npm install` rather than a ten-minute image rebuild.

**WHAT WAS DELETED VS WHAT WAS KEPT.** The historical 5.1.0 mentions in this file and in script
headers stay - they record measurements (the byte-identical VK, the 2,491 -> 2,518 template move) that
are the reason the pin is exact. What is gone is every place that would CAUSE 5.1.0 to be used.

**`~/.bb/bb` IS LEFT ALONE AND IS NOW INERT** - nothing here resolves to it. Removing an installed
toolchain from a home directory is the repo owner's call, not a script's: `rm -rf ~/.bb` if wanted.
The stale `:beta26-bb5.1.0` image was removed, since it is a build artifact and the Dockerfile that
made it is in git.

- [ ] The nargo pin is still `1.0.0-beta.26+quid-icefix1` on the host and stock `1.0.0-beta.26` in the
      container. That split is real and separate from bb - the patched compiler exists because stock
      beta.26 ICEs on `noir_dl_lib`. Worth checking whether the ICE is fixed upstream, which would
      collapse that pin too.

### 2.18eg REGENERATING THE 79 PASSPORT VERIFIERS - the recipe, written down before it is needed (user, 2026-08-05)

**NOT NEEDED TODAY.** The 79 in `passport/verifiers2/noir/` have NO proofs and no test deploys one, so
nothing is stale. They were built in this session with the container swapfile (`6120ec3`, `86a9788`
"75 of 75 now built on the current toolchain", `8d64f5d` six recovered profiles) and `27bebcf` proved
their keys stable across bb versions.

**THE TRIGGER IS A PROOF, NOT A VERSION.** Re-emit a verifier when a proof is first made against it
on a bb whose Solidity template differs - and only that profile, not all 79. Measured: the VK is
byte-identical between 5.1.0 and 6.0 while the emitted Solidity moved **2,491 -> 2,518 lines, 99
lines differing**. A verifier with no proofs is never stale; a verifier whose proofs move is stale
immediately, and its KEY will not show it.

**AND IT SHOULD NOW BE CHEAP.** `codegen-passport-verifiers.sh` keeps every key in
`backend/circuits/passport-vks/<profile>.vk` as of this session. `write_vk` is the entire cost - it is
what needs the swap - and `write_solidity_verifier -k <saved vk>` is a seconds-long reformat. **A
template-only regeneration needs no container, no swap and no CRS.** The recipe below is for the case
where a key genuinely has to be re-derived: a circuit change, or a bb that alters the key format.

---

**THE SWAP RECIPE, because none of it worked first time.**

**1. The Docker Desktop slider cannot do this.** It caps swap at 4 GB, and
`~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.docker/settings.json` is TCC-protected - a shell gets
`Operation not permitted` **even as its owner**, so it cannot be scripted. Do not try again.

**2. Swap is a kernel property of the VM, not a Desktop setting.** A `--privileged` container can add
a swapfile to that kernel and *every* container then sees it. Measured: 3,071 MB -> 5,119 MB with a
2 GB file. **The ceiling is disk, not the slider.**

**3. The swapfile MUST live on a NAMED VOLUME.** `/tmp` and the overlay root cannot host one and
`swapon` rejects them with `Invalid argument`, which names nothing useful.

```
docker volume create ibiza-swap
docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 --privileged \
  -v "$PWD":/repo -v ibiza-bb-crs:/root/.bb-crs -v ibiza-swap:/swap \
  -w /repo/backend/circuits <image> bash -lc '
    if [ ! -f /swap/bb.swap ] || [ "$(stat -c%s /swap/bb.swap)" -lt $((32*1024*1024*1024)) ]; then
      rm -f /swap/bb.swap
      fallocate -l 32G /swap/bb.swap && chmod 600 /swap/bb.swap && mkswap /swap/bb.swap
    fi
    swapon /swap/bb.swap 2>/dev/null || true
    free -g | head -3
    ./codegen-passport-verifiers.sh
  '
```

**4. `--privileged` is required for `swapon` and is the whole reason it is there.** Local build
container over a mounted tree; it signs nothing and holds no key.

**5. The swapfile PERSISTS in the volume** - allocate once, reuse forever. `chmod 600` before
`mkswap` or `swapon` refuses it.

**6. The CRS goes in its own named volume** (`ibiza-bb-crs`), so the ~2 GiB download happens once and
survives `--rm`.

**7. `--platform linux/amd64` is not optional on Apple silicon.**

**WHAT DOES NOT HELP, all tried against a known-failing profile and none moved the 11.2 GiB peak:**
`HARDWARE_CONCURRENCY=2` (bb honours it - "num threads: 2" - peak unchanged), `BB_STORAGE_BUDGET` (no
effect; the earlier claim that it halved memory was a false positive from comparing two DIFFERENT
circuits), pre-seeding a 2^25 CRS (bb dies before reaching it), and `--cpus=2` (the container still
reports 8 cores; `--cpuset-cpus=0-1` does change `nproc`, and still changes nothing that matters).
**The peak is the circuit's polynomials - 2^25 field elements x 32 bytes - so no scheduling knob
touches it.**

**AND THE FIVE HEAVIEST PROFILES ARE NOT A MEMORY PROBLEM AT ALL.** They need a 2^25-point CRS, which
is EXACTLY 2 GiB, and bb reads/writes the CRS whole-file in ONE syscall while macOS caps a single
write at 2 GiB - so it fails with `EINVAL` no matter how much RAM or swap exists. That is why the
container is Linux and not merely bigger. The five are listed in the script's `DEFAULT_PROFILES`.

**⚠️ `docker info` MemTotal is the VM's ALLOCATION, not host free RAM.** Closing apps does nothing.
Raise it at Docker Desktop -> Settings -> Resources -> Memory. Under-memory `rustc`/`bb` is
OOM-killed with NO diagnostic - it reads exactly like a compile error and is not one.

- [ ] **Regenerate a passport verifier only when its first proof exists**, from the saved key if the
      key is still valid (seconds, no container), and through the recipe above if it is not.
- [ ] **Back-fill `passport-vks/` for the 79 already built.** The keys were discarded by the old
      one-slot build directory, so the saving only helps profiles built from now on. Doing this once
      is the 32 GiB run - and it is the LAST one, because after it a template bump never needs the
      container again. **This is the item to schedule when there is a free machine-hour, not when a
      proof suddenly needs a verifier.**
- [ ] Nothing wires verifiers by address, so a wrong passport verifier would be caught by nothing.
      That gap is worth more than any of the above.

### 2.18ef GETTING RID OF 5.1.0 - one referenced artifact left, and it should be retired not upgraded (user, 2026-08-05)

*"upgrade any proofs we need to work with 6.0.0"* then *"why cant we get rid of 5.1.0 altogether?"* -
**we can, and we nearly have.** Nothing structurally required 5.1.0. Every verifier is a CLOSED LOOP -
key, Solidity verifier and proof fixture generated together - so moving one is a regeneration, not a
port.

**MOVED TO 6.0 AND GREEN (477 tests):** the recursion tree and everything under it; the five targets
in `codegen-verifiers.sh` (Withdrawal, Ragequit, EscrowEnvelope, NotaryAction, TitleHolder); the ten
light verifiers; the three escrow fixtures; every `pf_*` circuit-side proof. The chonk fold and its
root were 6.0 already.

**THE UPGRADE WAS FREE BECAUSE THE SHAPES DID NOT MOVE.** `withdraw_identity`'s recursion VK is
**byte-identical** under 5.1.0 and 6.0 - same 115 fields, same values - and every length constant
holds (proof 458, pub 7). `inner_vk.nr`'s pin never needed touching.

**WHICH IS ALSO THE HAZARD.** The proofs are still mutually unverifiable: each fails against the
other bb at `UltraVerifier: verification failed at reduction step`, with the same-toolchain control
run first and passing both ways. The incompatibility lives in the proof TRANSCRIPT, not the key, so
**a pinned-VK check - the exact guard `inner_vk.nr` is - cannot see it.**

**THE CASCADE, because it is invisible until it isn't.** Moving the escrow VERIFIER to 6.0 while
`escrow_envelope0..2.proof` stayed on 5.1.0 broke **17 tests with `SumcheckFailed()`** and no hint of
the cause. `tools/prove-escrow-fixtures.sh`'s own header predicts this word for word and says to run
it AFTER `codegen-verifiers.sh`, never instead. A verifier and its proofs are one artifact.

**WHAT IS LEFT, measured by asking which committed verifiers today did not touch AND something
references:**

| | on | referenced | proofs exist | action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`AggregationHonkVerifier`** | 5.1.0 | **yes, 2 refs** | yes, N=16 fixture | **regenerate** |
| `verifiers2/noir/*` (79 passport) | 5.1.0 | no | **NONE** | **none needed** |

**THE 79 PASSPORT VERIFIERS NEED NOTHING, and saying otherwise was wrong.** They were BUILT IN THIS
SESSION with the container swapfile - `6120ec3` "32 GiB of container-made swap builds the verifiers
that OOM'd", `86a9788` "75 of 75 now built on the current toolchain", plus six recovered profiles.
No proof or fixture exists for any of them and no test deploys one. They are emitted verifiers
waiting on a real document (task 6), so a 5.1.0 verifier with no proofs is not stale, it is idle.

**AND THE KEY WAS ALREADY PROVED STABLE, in `27bebcf`:** *"bb write_vk -t evm on withdraw_identity
produces a byte-identical key under both versions, sha256 366f53d7..., so the 89 verifiers generated
under 5.1.0 stay valid and nothing needs regenerating."* That still holds.

**SO WHY DID FIFTEEN VERIFIERS CHANGE TODAY? THE TEMPLATE, NOT THE KEY.** Diffed old against
regenerated: **VK constants differing = 0**, file length **2,491 -> 2,518 lines, 99 lines differing**.
bb 6.0 emits a different Solidity template. That only matters when the PROOFS move, because a
5.1.0-template verifier cannot check a 6.0 proof - which is what produced the 17 `SumcheckFailed()`
tests and the light-verifier rejection.

> **The refinement worth keeping: "the VK is byte-identical" proves nothing needs regenerating only
> while the proofs stay put. It is the PROOF that decides, not the key.** A verifier with no proofs
> is never stale; a verifier whose proofs move is stale immediately, and its key will not show it.

**AND THE 21.7 GB IS ALREADY SOLVED**, which I used as a reason to retire the flat aggregator and
should not have. `build-passport-verifiers-docker.sh` adds a 32 GiB swapfile on a named volume inside
a privileged container, and `AggregationProofOnChain.t.sol`'s own header records that this is how the
current fixture was produced: *"~27 GB to produce, so it cannot be made on an ordinary dev machine.
That was true until the container swapfile made it producible"*. So the cost is a known procedure,
not a blocker, and **whether to keep the flat aggregator is a question about whether it is still
wanted - not about what it costs to rebuild.**

**TWO PRE-EXISTING DEFECTS SURFACED, neither caused by bb.** `codegen-verifiers.sh` still emitted
`RegisterIdentityLightHonkVerifier`, which nothing references and which the ten-verifier light family
superseded - deleted. And the light test read `register_identity_light.proof` while the generator
writes `register_identity_light_td1.proof` for the SAME circuit (DG1_LEN 95, hash 32 IS the ID256
config) - two names for one artifact, now one.

- [x] **Regenerate `AggregationHonkVerifier` and its N=16 fixture on 6.0.** **DONE** (`f206f89`):
      write_vk 12.1 GB / 141 s, prove verified at 12.4 GB, and the fixture's sixteen members are now
      DISTINCT rather than sixteen copies. Original text: through the container
      swapfile. That removes the last referenced 5.1.0 artifact without deleting anything, and
      whether to then RETIRE the flat aggregator becomes a clean question about whether two settling
      paths plus a third is one too many.
- [x] ~~The 79 passport verifiers.~~ **Nothing to do.** No proofs, no fixtures, no test deploys one.
      Idle, not stale. Their real gap is that nothing wires verifiers by address, which is a separate
      item and not a toolchain one.
- [x] ~~`codegen-verifiers.sh`'s `REQUIRED_BB`.~~ **DONE** (`b57e788`): both guards take a single
      value and 5.1.0 is deleted tree-wide - see 2.18eh. Original text: Now that
      6.0 is the toolchain, invert it - and the moment nothing needs 5.1.0, make it the only value.

### 2.18ee THE FOLD REACHES THE CHAIN - I was wrong, and the fix is one constant (user, 2026-08-04)

*"are you sure there is no way to unblock IPA/Grumpkin"* - **no, and it was not blocked.** 2.18ea
called this path impossible on five failing experiments. Every one of those experiments was real; the
conclusion drawn from them was not. They showed IPA cannot be ACCUMULATED into an EVM proof. They did
not show it cannot be DISCHARGED, and I never asked.

**`PROOF_TYPE_ROOT_ROLLUP_HONK = 5` IS THE DISCHARGE POINT.** Type 4 (`ROLLUP_HONK`) accumulates the
child's IPA claim and leaves it nested, which is why `-t evm` kept refusing. Type 5 verifies the
inner product argument NATIVELY IN-CIRCUIT and leaves nothing nested - so what comes out is an
ordinary UltraHonk proof and `write_solidity_verifier` generates from it normally. The cost of that
discharge is visible in the numbers: the same circuit costs **1.7 GB at type 4 and 7.1 GB at type 5**.

**THE FULL CHAIN, RUN END TO END WITH REAL WITNESSES:**

| step | peak | out |
|---|---|---|
| 16 withdrawals -> chonk fold | **572 MB** | 1,223-field chonk proof |
| -> `withdraw_ivc_wrapper` (`-t noir-rollup`) | **1.9 GB** | 480-field rollup proof, IPA accumulated |
| -> root circuit (type 5, `-t evm`) | **8.87 GB** | **358-field proof, IPA discharged** |
| -> `ChonkRootHonkVerifier.sol` | 18,762 B deployed, 5,814 B margin | **6/6 on-chain tests pass** |

**EXACTLY TWO CHILDREN, NOT ONE.** A single-child root is refused outright: *"Root rollup must
accumulate two IPA proofs"*. So one on-chain proof settles TWO folds, and a partial batch pads the
second child rather than omitting it.

**AND THE GAS IS THE REAL RESULT:**

| | total | per withdrawal |
|---|---|---|
| flat aggregation, 16 | 2,980,094 | 186,255 |
| recursion tree, 16 | 2,776,678 | 173,542 |
| **fold + root, 32** | **2,902,966** | **90,717** |

Roughly half, because one verification covers 32 rather than 16. **And it keeps falling**, because
the chonk proof is CONSTANT SIZE in N (1,223 fields at both N=4 and N=16, measured) and the wrapper
and root circuits are fixed. Two folds of 64 would be the same ~2.9M gas across 128 withdrawals -
**~22.7k each, with no new circuits and no new verifier**. The tree cannot do that: a bigger batch
needs another level and a new deployed verifier.

**WHAT THIS FIXTURE IS NOT.** Both children are the SAME fold, so the four public inputs are two
identical `(commitment, count)` pairs. It tests the MECHANISM and does not show that two DISTINCT
batches compose. Settling it would be settling the same sixteen withdrawals twice - nullifiers would
refuse it, but the proof verifies, so this is not evidence the root binds two different batches.

**THE LESSON, since it is the second time this has happened today.** 2.18ea's five experiments all
agreed with each other and all pointed the same way, and that felt like proof. It was five instances
of the same question. The one that mattered - "can the claim be discharged rather than carried?" -
was never asked, and the answer was one constant away.

- [x] **Prove two DISTINCT folds under one root.** Needs a second batch of 16 witnesses  **OBSOLETE**: chonk is retired (2.18em).
      (`build-fold-witnesses.js --count 32`, members 16..31). Until then the root is unproven on the
      only property that makes it useful.
- [x] **Decide between the tree and the fold+root**, now that both settle on-chain. Tree: 2.11 GB  **DECIDED: the tree** (2.18el).
      peak, batch size is compile-time, 173,542 gas each. Fold+root: 8.87 GB peak for the discharge
      but 572 MB for the folds themselves, ANY batch size with one circuit set, 90,717 each at 32 and
      falling. **The axis is whether an 8.87 GB step once per settlement is acceptable** - it is under
      this machine's 16 GB, but it is not a phone and not a small VM.
- [x] ~~Re-price the "wait for a later bb" option in 2.18eb.~~ **CLOSED by the repo owner: "we cannot
      wait for a later bb".** It is also moot - nothing on either settlement path needs one. The tree
      runs on 5.1.0 and the fold+root runs on the 6.0 nightly already installed. The version is now
      PINNED in `backend/circuits/package.json` rather than living in a scratchpad, because a path
      that only works on one machine's node_modules is not a path.
- [x] ~~Grumpkin/precompile analysis.~~ Not a task - a correction, kept for the record. It is still
      CORRECT and still the reason there is no
      on-chain IPA verifier. It just was not the reason the path was blocked.

### 2.18ed 572 MB vs 2.11 GB IS NOT A REGRESSION - it is the price of EVM-verifiability (user, 2026-08-04)

*"i thought you reported 578mb earlier? why did we grow to 2.11"* - **fair question, and the two
numbers belong to two different designs.** Nothing grew.

| | measured peak | reaches the EVM |
|---|---|---|
| chonk fold, N=16 | **572 MB** (546 MiB) | **no** - blocked on IPA/Grumpkin, see 2.18ea |
| recursion tree, N=16 | **2.11 GB** (2,015 MiB) | **yes** - verifier deployed, proof accepted |
| flat aggregation, N=16 | ~21.7 GB | yes |

**WHY THE TREE COSTS MORE, structurally.** A fold step does not verify a proof at all - it folds an
instance into an accumulator - so its circuits are tiny: app **70,003** gates, kernels 49,177-62,138,
hiding **36,587**. A tree node performs **TWO complete in-circuit UltraHonk verifications**, which is
the ~798k-gates-each term 2.18dk isolated, hence **1,544,632** (leaf) and **1,487,966** (internal).

**~22x the gates for 3.7x the memory**, because the fold's 546 MiB is mostly fixed overhead - SRS and
thread pools - rather than its circuits. So the fold is not 22x more efficient; it is small enough
that the constant term dominates.

**2.11 GB IS THE FLOOR FOR THIS APPROACH, and both ways out were checked:**
- **Drop ZK.** The non-ZK pair (410 fields, `PROOF_TYPE_HONK = 0`) gives **1,444,442** gates against
  1,487,966 - a **2.9%** saving. Not worth asking whether a non-ZK inner proof leaks witness material
  to the batcher on a privacy pool. **Rejected on measurement, not on principle.**
- **Change the arity.** Wider nodes (verify 4 per node) cut depth but roughly double per-node gates,
  which moves memory the wrong way. Narrower is impossible: a node must verify the node below it
  PLUS one new proof, so two verifications is the minimum any recursion step can do. Arity-2 is both
  the floor and the shape that parallelises best (4 independent levels at N=16).

**SO THE REAL COMPARISON IS 2.11 GB AGAINST 21.7 GB**, not against 572 MB. The fold's number is real
and is the record, but it buys a proof nothing on Ethereum can check.

- [x] ~~The fold has no stated job.~~ **Retired (2.18em).**

### 2.18ec THE BATCH COMMITMENT HAD SILENTLY DIVERGED, and its guard could not fire (2026-08-04)

**`BatchCommitmentLib` folded with chained Poseidon v1 while `aggregate_withdrawals::batch_commitment`
had moved to a single keccak256.** They are the two halves of the only thing tying the aggregation
verifier's ONE public input back to the withdrawals a batch settles. Nothing failed, because nothing
was asking the right question.

**HOW IT SURVIVED.** `BatchCommitmentTest.test_MatchesTheCircuit` compared Solidity against a FROZEN
CONSTANT (`0x10b1c1fb...`). A pinned number asks "has Solidity changed", and the question is "do the
two SIDES agree". The circuit moved; the constant did not; the test stayed green. Its own header
warned that *"the divergence is SILENT in both directions and neither side can detect it alone"* -
which was right, and then the test was built so that it could not detect it either.

**MEASURED, with the control run before concluding.** For the vector `pi[i][j] = i*100+j+1`:

| | value |
|---|---|
| circuit at N=16 (keccak) | `0x1f69398f18eef4e530393f48db2c7187ceda1da1ead0c3cfa7c0752ba3169693` |
| contract at N=16 (Poseidon) | `0x10b1c1fb68f9667a893d791c0b18afe571ac415a0377e9bff7a1d2c9224d9349` |

The reproduction was validated against the REAL circuit before either number was trusted:
`nargo test --show-output` at N=2 emits
`0x2769ca7e6b0f6b41f45f61a850fb6c3d83b2cf85f4e3658b20b4a83b861a9cda`, and an independent keccak fold
of the same vector reproduces it exactly. Without that control the N=16 figure would have rested on
my own transcription of the circuit.

**WHICH SIDE MOVED, established before touching anything.** The circuit. `aggregate_withdrawals`
carries **no poseidon dependency at all**, the `fold_signals` this library claimed to mirror **no
longer exists**, and the circuit's own comment describes the contract taking
`uint256(keccak256(...)) % SNARK_SCALAR_FIELD`. Keccak on both sides was the intended design and only
the Solidity was left behind.

**BLAST RADIUS.** `BatchVerifierLib.verifyBatch` is the only caller, and it is not yet wired into
settlement - it *"DELIBERATELY DOES NOT SETTLE"*. So no funds were reachable. But it is the
aggregation entrypoint, and every real batch would have reverted `InvalidBatchProof`. Fail-closed,
which is the safe direction and is exactly why it went unnoticed for as long as it did.

**FIXED, one money-path change, prediction stated first and all four held:** the library reproduces
the circuit's construction; order, length and per-signal binding all still hold (concatenation is
binding in all three); the empty batch stops being `0`; gas drops sharply - **42,825 total, 2,676 per
withdrawal**, against two Poseidon permutations per withdrawal before.

**THE TEST NO LONGER HOLDS A FROZEN NUMBER.** It transcribes the circuit independently of the library
and anchors that transcription to a value the circuit actually printed, so moving either side breaks
it. A second implementation on purpose: if the library is edited to match a wrong idea of the
circuit, the transcription does not follow.

**AND A SECOND TEST WAS ASLEEP THE SAME WAY.** `WithdrawBatchGuards.test_EmptyBatchIsRejected`
asserted only that the empty fold was zero and **never exercised the guard its name promises**. It
now calls `verifyBatch` and requires `EmptyBatch`, with `address(0)` as the verifier so that
reverting with that error rather than a failed call is itself the evidence the check short-circuits.

- [ ] **Audit the other cross-language pins for the same shape.** `NotaryRegistryProofTest` is cited
      as the model for this kind of guard - check whether it compares against a frozen constant or a
      construction. Any pin that cannot detect the OTHER side moving is decoration.
- [x] ~~Confirm nothing else assumed the empty commitment was zero.~~ **Grep run; there is no third
      place.** Moot regardless: under the tree an empty batch has NO commitment - `BatchTooSmall`.

### 2.18eb OFF-CHAIN ATTESTATION IS NOT NEEDED - a recursion TREE is fully on-chain at 2.1 GB (user, 2026-08-04)

*"why is off chain attestation needed? you cant make it fully onchain"* - **the question was right and
the option table in 2.18ea was wrong.** It priced "on-chain and heavy" against "cheap and trusted" and
never priced the thing that is both, so it framed a false choice.

**THE 21.7 GB WAS NEVER THE PRICE OF ON-CHAIN VERIFICATION.** It is the price of verifying sixteen
proofs in ONE circuit. A recursion TREE - each node verifying exactly two proofs - never builds a big
circuit, and its root is an ordinary UltraHonk proof the EVM verifies with a generated Solidity
verifier. No chonk anywhere, so no IPA, so no Grumpkin, so no blocked hop.

**MEASURED, not argued (bb 5.1.0, the pin the aggregator already uses):**

| | flat N=16 (2.18dk) | **recursion tree** | chonk fold (2.18ea) |
|---|---|---|---|
| fully on-chain | yes | **yes** | **no - blocked** |
| peak memory | **~21.7 GB** | **2.11 GB** | 572 MB |
| gates per step | 12,720,801 | **1,544,632** leaf / **1,487,966** internal | n/a |
| one node, write_vk + prove | - | **10.9 s + 18.1 s, verified** | - |
| Solidity verifier | 2,491 lines, deployed | **2,491 lines, GENERATED, proof verifies** | impossible |
| batch size | compile-time | tree depth; one more level DOUBLES capacity | any N |
| partial batches | impossible | a padded subtree | free |

**THE INTERNAL NODE IS THE ONE THAT COULD HAVE BROKEN IT, and it does not.** A level-2 node verifies
aggregation proofs rather than withdrawal proofs, so the worry was that it costs more. It costs
**less** - 1,487,966 against 1,544,632 - because a recursive UltraHonk proof is **458 fields whatever
circuit produced it** (proof length is fixed by flavour, not by circuit size), and the internal node
folds one public input per child instead of seven.

**N=16 ARITHMETIC:** 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = **15 nodes**, each ~1.5M gates / ~18 s / ~2.1 GB. Sequential that
is ~270 s against the flat circuit's 280,492 ms **for the proving key alone**; the levels are
independent, so the critical path is 4 x 18 s if they run in parallel. **Same or better wall-clock,
one tenth the memory, and it stays trustless.**

**WHAT IS NOT YET DONE, so the green is not over-read:**
- ONE leaf and ONE internal node were proven, not a full 15-node tree.
- The internal node was fed the SAME child proof twice. That is a valid COST measurement and NOT a
  correctness test - it is the identical-members trap 2.18ea called out in the old N=16 fixture, and
  it must not be repeated when the tree is built for real.
- The 16 inner proofs in `aggregate_withdrawals/Prover.toml` are still sixteen IDENTICAL copies.
  `tools/build-fold-witnesses.js` now produces 16 DISTINCT withdrawals against one state tree, and
  `withdraw_identity` takes the same twenty inputs as `withdraw_ivc_app` - so the flat fixture can be
  upgraded from copies to real members with no new machinery.
- Under bb 6.0 those existing inner proofs FAIL to verify in-circuit (`UltraVerifier: verification
  failed at reduction step`). The UltraHonk recursion format moved between 5.1.0 and 6.0. The tree is
  a 5.1.0 artifact today; folding is a 6.0 one. **Two toolchains in one tree is a standing hazard.**

- [x] **Build the tree for real.** **DONE** (`fa9b97a`, rebuilt on 6.0 in `0619aa8`): 15 nodes,
      depth 4, 301 s, 2.19 GB, verifier deployed and 5/5 on-chain tests pass. Original text: Four circuits (or one merge circuit with the child VK pinned by
      hash), 16 distinct withdrawals from the fold generator, full 15-node run, and the root's
      verifier deployed. Predict first: the root proof should be 440 fields with 1 public input and
      the tree hash should match what the contract recomputes.
- [x] `BatchCommitmentLib` moves from a flat keccak over all members to the TREE hash, and the  **DONE (`aa29fb4`)**.
      contract recomputes the tree rather than the flat fold. This is the money-path change; one per
      run, with the prediction stated first.
- [x] ~~Decide what the chonk fold is FOR.~~ **Nothing - retired (2.18em).** Partial batches turned
      out not to need it: the tree pads.
- [x] ~~Pin ONE toolchain per path.~~ **DONE, and better than asked** (`b57e788`): there is now ONE
      toolchain for every path, not one per path. bb 5.1.0 is deleted.

### 2.18ea THE FOLD RUNS: 16 REAL WITHDRAWALS, ONE PROOF, AND EXACTLY ONE HOP LEFT (2026-08-04)

**The prediction in 2.18dk is settled, and folding won.** That section said the number to read off is
the decider's cost, and set the bar: *"if the decider lands near ~800k gates folding wins by ~16x; if
it lands near 12.7M the problem has been MOVED, not solved."*

| | flat aggregation (2.18dk) | folded (this run) |
|---|---|---|
| N=16 proof | 370 fields | **1,223 fields (39,136 bytes)** |
| **peak memory** | **~21.7 GB** (12.5 GB resident + 9.2 GB swap) | **572 MB** |
| proving | 280,492 ms for the proving key alone | whole stack in well under a minute |
| circuit | 12,720,801 gates, **recompiled per N** | 5 fixed circuits, **same for any N** |
| N=4 vs N=16 proof size | different circuits entirely | **byte-identical, 39,136 both** |

**Constant size is measured, not argued.** The N=4 and N=16 proofs are the same length to the byte.
The first two fields of the proof are the public inputs: the batch commitment, and `count` = 0x10.

**THE WITNESSES ARE SIXTEEN DIFFERENT PEOPLE NOW.** The old N=16 aggregation fixture was sixteen
IDENTICAL copies of one withdrawal - same 458 proof fields, same seven signals, repeated. It could
never have caught a fold that collapses its members, because an accumulator over sixteen copies of X
is indistinguishable from one that keeps only the last X. `tools/build-fold-witnesses.js` builds N
distinct spends against ONE state tree; `IdentityRegistry.t.sol` now emits all three registered
identities against one shared root. Duplicate nullifier hashes, duplicate change commitments, and
duplicate seven-signal sets are all refused, in both the generator and the orchestrator.

**THREE THINGS WERE WRONG AND ONLY ONE ANNOUNCED ITSELF.**

1. **bb leaves the chonk `key_hash` EMPTY and checks it anyway.** No `vk_hash` file from the binary
   form, `"hash": ""` from the JSON form. Zero gives `Recursive Ultra Verifier: VK Hash Mismatch`. The
   value is Poseidon2 over the key's fields - now computed by `circuits/vk_hash`, which compiles
   against the same poseidon pin the kernels do. It must NOT be computed inside the kernel: a kernel
   hashing the key it was handed checks `hash(key) == hash(key)`, which holds for any key and still
   prints "folding verified".
2. **The first inner kernel was handed the wrong predecessor VK.** Its predecessor is the INIT kernel,
   not another inner kernel. IVC is a chain, so one wrong key failed every fold after it - the log
   named four broken steps and not the one that was actually wrong.
3. **`kind` is now a required msgpack field** (App=0/Kernel=1/HidingKernel=2, uint32). This was the
   only honest failure of the three: `Missing field kind`, before anything ran.

**THE WRAPPER PROVES AGAINST THE REAL FOLD.** `bb prove --verifier_target noir-rollup` on
`withdraw_ivc_wrapper` with the genuine N=16 chonk proof: **Proof verified successfully**, 9.4 s,
1.9 GB peak, 480 proof fields, and its public inputs carry the batch commitment and `count` = 16
unchanged. This is the first time the chonk recursion has been exercised with real witnesses rather
than the dummy ones `write_vk` uses.

**AND HERE IS THE HOP THAT IS MISSING - stated as a blocked path, not a to-do that can be worked
around.** ⚠️ **THIS CONCLUSION WAS WRONG. See 2.18ee: the path exists and now verifies on-chain.**
The checks below are all real; what they establish is that IPA cannot be ACCUMULATED into an EVM
proof, and I read that as "cannot reach the EVM" without asking whether it could be DISCHARGED.
`PROOF_TYPE_ROOT_ROLLUP_HONK = 5` discharges it. Kept as written because the reasoning error is the
useful part: five failing experiments agreeing with each other is not the same as a proof of
impossibility, and I treated it as one.

No nargo-built circuit that recursively verifies a chonk proof can produce an
EVM-verifiable proof on bb 6.0.0-nightly. Five checks, each run rather than reasoned:

- `write_vk -t evm` on the wrapper: `TripleIPA openings present when not expected. Actual: 1`.
- Only rollup IO carries them: *"ROLLUP_HONK and ROOT_ROLLUP_HONK must be recursively verified using
  an IO type with HasIPA=true."*
- Rollup circuits cannot use the EVM hash: *"Rollup circuits (ipa_accumulation=true) must use
  oracle_hash_type='poseidon2', got 'keccak'"*, and `--verifier_target` is refused alongside
  `--ipa_accumulation` outright.
- `write_solidity_verifier` on the rollup key: `verification key has wrong size: expected 1888, got
  3680`. There is no `noir-rollup` target for Solidity, only `evm` / `evm-no-zk`.
- A further circuit verifying the wrapper's ROLLUP_HONK proof at EVM target fails identically:
  `IPA proofs present when not expected`.

bb does have a discharge point - *"Root rollup must accumulate two IPA proofs"* - but `is_root_rollup`
is derived inside bb from proof types Noir cannot emit here. **Verifying two chonk folds in one
circuit was tried and does not reach it**: two openings are rejected exactly as one is.

**WHY IT IS NOT A PACKAGING GAP, which decides whether waiting is a strategy.** IPA in barretenberg
runs over **Grumpkin** (`bb::IPA<bb::curve::Grumpkin, 15>` in the binary). Ethereum's precompiles are
BN254-only - `0x06` ecAdd, `0x07` ecMul, `0x08` ecPairing - and the generated Honk verifier uses
exactly those. A grep of `AggregationHonkVerifier.sol` for Grumpkin/IPA terms returns two hits and
both are a scalar constant (`GRUMPKIN_CURVE_B_PARAMETER_NEGATED = 17`), not group arithmetic; the
control on the same file finds 50 pairing terms and a real `address(0x08).staticcall`. So the grep
can tell the difference, and there is no Grumpkin EC arithmetic on chain. An on-chain IPA verifier
would mean writing Grumpkin group operations in pure Solidity. **bb is not withholding this feature;
the EVM cannot afford it.**

**THE THREE OPTIONS, PRICED. Note first what folding never promised: cheaper gas.** It promised a
batcher that runs on a laptop, one circuit for any N, and partial batches. On-chain verification cost
was never the axis it improved.

| | A: flat aggregation (today) | B: fold + off-chain verify | C: wait for bb |
|---|---|---|---|
| works now | **yes, measured on-chain** | yes off-chain, measured | **no** |
| batcher memory | **~21.7 GB** - a server | **572 MB** - a phone could not, a laptop can | 572 MB |
| on-chain gas, N=16 | **2,980,094 (186,255/withdrawal)** | none - nothing is verified on chain | ~same order; folding does not cut gas |
| batch size | **compile-time**; 16 and 256 are different circuits AND different deployed verifiers | **any N, same circuit, same proof size** | any N |
| partial batches | **impossible** | free | free |
| trust | trustless - the chain checks the proof | **the batcher is trusted**, which is exactly the raid/takedown target already flagged in 2.18dp | trustless |
| dependency | none | none | **latest published bb is 6.0.0-nightly.20260804 and it does not expose this**; unknown timeline |

**A IS THE ONLY TRUSTLESS OPTION THAT WORKS TODAY**, and B's trust cost lands on the single point of
failure 2.18dp already identified. C is not a plan, it is a hope with no date. The honest reading is
that the fold is **built, measured and correct, and cannot yet carry a withdrawal to L1** - so it
does not replace the flat aggregator, it sits beside it until the hop exists.

- [x] **Decide the EVM hop.** ~~A call for the repo owner.~~ **SUPERSEDED by 2.18eb: the question
      "why is off chain attestation needed" dissolved the choice.** A recursion tree is fully

### 2.18dy The folded stack, built and measured (2026-08-04)

Five circuits, all compiling, all measured. The wrapper is the only one bb 5.1.0 cannot build, exactly
as predicted.

| circuit | gates | in the fold? |
|---|---|---|
| `withdraw_ivc_app` | 70,003 | yes, cheap |
| `withdraw_ivc_kernel_init` | 49,177 | yes |
| `withdraw_ivc_kernel_inner` | 62,138 | yes, x15 |
| `withdraw_ivc_hiding` | 36,587 | yes |
| **`withdraw_ivc_wrapper`** | **1,410,177** | **NO - this is what gets proven conventionally and verified on-chain** |

**Against `aggregate_withdrawals` at N=16: 12,707,593 gates. The wrapper is 9.01x smaller.**

And it is smaller than Aztec's own `rollup_tx_base_private` (2,732,848) because ours does less: theirs
carries 66 public inputs and rollup logic, ours verifies the fold and exposes two fields.

**The size does not grow with the batch.** Ours pays ~798k gates per withdrawal because it verifies
each proof in-circuit. This verifies one accumulated proof, so folding four costs what folding four
hundred costs. Extrapolating memory from our own 12.7M-gate run at ~21.7 GB puts 1.41M near **2.4 GB**,
plus the 377 MB the accumulation measured. **The batcher stops being a server.**

**What the app circuit costs, honestly.** 70,003 gates under chonk against `withdraw_identity`'s 44,176
under UltraHonk - the Mega arithmetization is wider. That cost is paid inside the fold, where a step is
~10 MB, rather than in the wrapper. Same for the keccak: the chained commitment absorbs one withdrawal
per kernel instead of all sixteen in the expensive circuit.

**Two errors worth keeping, both from inferring instead of reading.** `PROOF_TYPE_HN` is 2; I carried
over 6 from `aggregate_withdrawals`' `HONK_PROOF_TYPE`, a different enumeration, and the failure named
the proof size rather than the constant. And the inner kernel must use `PROOF_TYPE_HN` for BOTH
verifications - mixing it with `OINK` fails with "both honk and HN recursion constraints present";
`OINK` belongs only to init, where the app it verifies is first in the stack.

- [ ] Fold a real sixteen-withdrawal stack end to end. Needs witnesses threaded through the chain
      (each kernel's input is the previous kernel's output), not the sixteen identical copies used for
      the memory measurement in 2.18dr.
- [ ] Generate the wrapper's EVM verifier and check it against `BatchVerifierLib`, which must move from
      the flat fold to the chained one and start checking `count` against `signals.length`.

### 2.18dx Designing the fold to keep its advantages, not just its gate count (user, 2026-08-04)

Three properties of the folded shape are worth more than the 4.65x, and two of them dissolve problems
this file has spent a lot of words on. Building to reproduce the current design in a new place would
throw them away.

**1. The wrapper is constant in N, so N stops being a circuit parameter.** Our
`aggregate_withdrawals` hardcodes `BATCH_N` at compile time and pays ~798k gates per proof, which is
why 16 and 256 are different circuits with different verifiers. The folded wrapper verifies ONE
accumulated proof regardless of how many were folded into it. So:
- **the depth-2 tree is unnecessary.** 2.18ds treated 256 as a second circuit needing its own verifier
  and its own deployment. With folding you simply fold more times. Same circuit, same verifier, same
  deployed address.
- **raising N later costs nothing on-chain.** No redeploy, no second verifier, no migration.

**2. Variable batch size becomes possible, which is the fill problem's actual cure.** Today
`BatchVerifierLib.verifyBatch` accepts `signals.length < maxBatch` and no proof can satisfy it, because
the commitment fold is length-binding and the circuit folds exactly `BATCH_N` (2.18ds). A batcher must
pad to sixteen with dummy withdrawals they prove and pay for. Folding removes the compile-time N
entirely: you fold whatever is queued, thread the count through the kernels, and the wrapper exposes
the commitment over exactly that many. **Partial batches work.** Settle four at 3am and sixteen at
noon. The elect-to-wait queue (2.18ds) stops needing to reach a threshold before anyone gets paid, and
the padding waste disappears.

**3. Put the keccak in the KERNELS, not the wrapper.** The batch commitment must stay keccak, because
the choice was decided by the contract side: a Poseidon fold costs ~287,969 gas per withdrawal to
recompute on-chain against keccak's ~2k for the whole batch. In-circuit that costs ~511k gates. In the
recursive design that lands in the one expensive circuit. In the folded design it belongs in the
kernel, folded once per withdrawal, because **work inside a folded step is cheap (measured: ~10 MB and
a flat 359 MiB across sixteen accumulations) while work in the wrapper is what the on-chain-bound proof
pays for.** Same total keccak, moved from the expensive side to the cheap side.

**What this means for the contract.** `BatchCommitmentLib.batchCommitment` already folds however many
signal sets it is given, so it needs no change for variable N. `verifyBatch`'s `maxBatch` check becomes
a real bound rather than an unreachable branch, and the `BatchTooLarge` guard keeps meaning something
while `signals.length < maxBatch` starts being satisfiable.

- [ ] Thread the accumulated COUNT through the kernels so the wrapper can expose it, and check it
      against `signals.length` on-chain. Without it a batcher could present sixteen signal sets against
      a proof that folded four.

### 2.18dw The folding number, measured directly (2026-08-04)

The tooling gap closed cheaply. Our `bb` is 5.1.0, the latest RELEASE, but Aztec's master is
`6.0.0-nightly` and it is published on npm as `@aztec/bb.js`. That package ships a working CLI. It
builds the circuits ours refuses, so no C++ build was needed.

**Measured on the same binary, same command:**

| circuit | gates | acir opcodes | grows with N? |
|---|---|---|---|
| our `aggregate_withdrawals`, N=16 | **12,707,593** | 51,762 | **yes**, ~798k per proof |
| Aztec `rollup_tx_base_private`, verifies a FOLDED proof | **2,732,848** | 269,913 | **no** |
| Aztec `hiding_kernel_to_rollup` | 40,234 | 1,419 | no |

**Folding's final circuit is 4.65x smaller than our aggregator at N=16, and it does not grow.** Ours
verifies sixteen proofs in-circuit and pays ~798k gates for each. The folded route verifies one
accumulated proof, so N=256 costs the same 2.7M as N=16. At N=256 ours would be roughly 204M gates,
which is not buildable; folding stays flat.

Extrapolating memory from our own 12.7M-gate run at ~21.7 GB puts 2.7M near 4.6 GB, plus the 377 MB
the accumulation itself measured (2.18dr). A batcher becomes a laptop, which is what 2.18dp's
concentration problem needed.

**A stale artifact caught in passing.** `aggregate_withdrawals/target` still held the `BATCH_N=2` build
from the differential in 2.18dk; the source said 16 and the compiled artifact said 2. Recompiled. The
committed N=16 proof and its fixture are unaffected, since they were produced from the N=16 build
before the differential. Worth noting because `bb gates` reads the ARTIFACT, so a stale target silently
reports the wrong circuit.

**What is still needed to actually use this**, and it is now a list of engineering rather than unknowns:
- [ ] Restructure `withdraw_identity` to `return_data`, and write the kernel and hiding circuits.
      Aztec's equivalents are twelve and ten lines (2.18du), and their crates compile on our nargo.
- [ ] Write our own chonk-verifying wrapper, the analogue of `rollup_tx_base_private`, and emit its EVM
      verifier. Build it with `@aztec/bb.js@6.0.0-nightly` rather than our pinned 5.1.0.
- [ ] Decide whether to move the whole repo to a 6.0 toolchain or keep 5.1.0 for everything except this
      path. Two bb versions in one repo is its own hazard.

### 2.18dv The decider number, found (2026-08-04)

I said twice that this was out of reach. It was not. Aztec publish their compiled circuits to npm as
`@aztec/protocol-circuits-artifacts`, and every artifact carries a precomputed `verificationKey` whose
first field is log2 of the padded circuit size.

**Verified the reading against a circuit we already know**: our aggregation vk is `[24, 9, 5]`, and its
generated Solidity says `circuitSize: 16777216` = 2^24. Field 0 is the log, field 1 the public input
count.

| circuit | padded size | public inputs | grows with N? |
|---|---|---|---|
| our `aggregate_withdrawals`, N=16 | **2^24** (12,720,801 actual gates) | 9 | **yes**, ~798k gates per added proof |
| Aztec `rollup_tx_base_private`, which verifies a FOLDED proof | **2^22** | 66 | **no** |
| Aztec `hiding_kernel_to_rollup` | 2^16 | 1309 | no |

**So the decider-equivalent is 4x smaller than our N=16 aggregator, and constant in N.** Ours grows by
~798k gates per withdrawal because it verifies each proof in-circuit. The chonk route verifies ONE
folded proof, so batching 256 costs the same 2^22 as batching 16. That is the whole argument for
folding, now with numbers rather than expectation.

Extrapolating memory from our own 2^24 run at ~21.7 GB, a 2^22 circuit lands near 5-6 GB, plus 377 MB
for the accumulation itself (2.18dr, measured). A batcher stops being a server and becomes a laptop,
which is exactly what 2.18dp needed to stop the role concentrating.

**The remaining blocker is unchanged and is purely tooling.** Our `bb` cannot build a circuit
containing HN recursion constraints - it fails with `not supported with UltraBuilder` under every
target, including on Aztec's own published artifact. Their gate script uses `bb-avm`, a different
binary built from barretenberg source. So the figures above are read from published VKs rather than
measured here, and building the wrapper ourselves needs that binary.

**Caveat on transferability, stated because it is easy to overclaim.** 2^22 is AZTEC's wrapper, with
their 66 public inputs and their kernel public-input structure. Ours would differ at the margins. What
transfers is the shape: verifying one folded proof is a fixed cost that does not scale with the number
folded, and it lands two powers of two below our current aggregator.

- [ ] Build `bb-avm` from barretenberg source to compile and measure our own wrapper. That is now the
      only thing between us and a folded batcher, and it is a C++ build rather than an unknown.

### 2.18du Folding researched properly: Aztec's is coupled, the general one is unfinished, and its decider needs a ceremony (2026-08-04)

Chased "has anyone done this successfully outside Aztec". Two implementations exist and neither is
available to us.

**Aztec's chonk is production, and coupled to their transaction shape.** `chonk_tail_circuits.json` is
literally `["hiding"]`, and `mock-hiding/src/main.nr` verifies the PREVIOUS KERNEL's proof through
`call_data(0)` with `PROOF_TYPE_HN_FINAL`. So the stack is application, kernel, application, kernel,
closing with the hiding kernel.

**And do not measure it on their mocks.** `barretenberg/cpp/CLAUDE.md` says so directly: never
benchmark against test binaries, because test circuits are small mocks whose cost profile does not
resemble real proving workloads. Their pinned flows are real but they are AZTEC's transactions, and the
decider is sized by the circuits in the stack, so a number from their flow does not transfer to sixteen
`withdraw_identity` instances.

**The general-purpose library is `privacy-ethereum/sonobe`, and its support matrix is the answer:**

| | status |
|---|---|
| Nova | stable |
| ProtoGalaxy | to be merged (PR 247) |
| HyperNova, Ova, Mova | to be merged |
| **Decider (LegoGroth16)** | **to be merged (PR 259)** |
| Noir frontend | **WIP, on a branch** |

Only Nova is stable, the Noir frontend is unmerged work, and there is **no merged decider at all**. So
today sonobe folds without being able to compress the accumulator into something a chain verifies.

**The part that matters more than maturity: the decider is a Groth16-family SNARK.** LegoGroth16 needs a
trusted setup. So general folding does not avoid the ceremony question, it moves it from the withdrawal
circuit to the decider circuit. Having just declined a ceremony (2.18dt), we would be walking back into
one by a longer road, and this time for a circuit that is harder to explain to contributors.

**Where this leaves the batcher.** Folding's accumulation genuinely is ~57x cheaper (2.18dr, measured).
Both routes to a usable decider are closed for us: Aztec's needs their kernels, sonobe's needs a
ceremony and is not finished. So the batcher stays at ~21.7 GB and remains a standing target, and
2.18dp's concentration problem has no open route rather than an unexplored one.

- [ ] Recheck sonobe when ProtoGalaxy (PR 247), the decider (PR 259) and the Noir frontend land. If the
      decider ever ships without a per-circuit setup, this reopens immediately.

### 2.18dt Decided: no ceremony, batch stays at 16 (user, 2026-08-04)

Two decisions from the repo owner that reverse what 2.18do and 2.18ds recorded earlier the same day.
Both rest on measurements from this session rather than preference.

**No Groth16 ceremony, so no second prover.** A ceremony's security comes from contributors who are
identifiable and reputationally exposed, because nothing in the transcript proves contributors are
distinct people. One actor with a script produces five hundred pseudonymous contributions that verify
identically. Bulk therefore hides the problem instead of solving it, and the earlier claim in this file
that a thousand contributors makes anonymity acceptable was backwards. Aztec's ignition is credible
because named parties took part, which is not something a young protocol can assemble on demand.

Consequences, stated so nobody re-derives them:
- withdrawals stay at **2,528,007** immediate and **186,255** batched at N=16;
- the ~213,882 Groth16 figure and the 11.8x are off the table, along with the second prover, the zkey
  on the phone, the three integration seams and the frozen-circuit constraint;
- `noir-gnark` is no longer on the critical path. It stays interesting only if the ceremony question
  reopens.

**Batch stays at N=16.** The depth-2 tree reaches ~15k per withdrawal and needs 256 in the queue. Fill
dominates the arithmetic: a queue that takes weeks is a lockup rather than a wait, and the tree's
advantage only arrives once demand fills it faster than users will tolerate. Sixteen fills sooner and
saves 13.6x against a single, which is most of the available win.

The depth-2 work is shelved, not deleted. If volume ever makes 256 fill in hours, deploying the root
verifier alongside the existing one is safe, because both are Honk against the same SRS.

**What this leaves open, and it is the uncomfortable part.** The immediate path is now 2,528,007, which
is the price someone pays when they cannot wait, or when every batcher refuses them. That is the
censorship escape hatch, and it is expensive. Groth16 would have made it cheap. Nothing else on the
table does.

And the batcher still needs ~21.7 GB, so it stays a server and a standing target. Folding was the
in-stack answer to that and it is blocked on Aztec's hiding kernel (2.18dr). So batcher concentration
is unresolved, with no route currently open.

### 2.18dr Folding: accumulation is ~57x cheaper, and the decider needs a circuit we do not have (2026-08-04)

Pushed the chonk prototype to the decider. It gets there, and then names its blocker precisely.

**Accumulation works and scales gently.** Peak memory folding real `withdraw_identity` instances:

| instances | peak |
|---|---|
| 4 | 257 MB |
| 8 | 304 MB |
| 12 | 356 MB |
| 16 | 377 MB |

Roughly a 200 MB base plus about 10 MB per instance. The recursive aggregator needs ~21.7 GB for the
same sixteen, so accumulation is around 57x cheaper and scales at ~10 MB per proof against ~1.35 GB.
This is the ProtoGalaxy property doing what it claims: no in-circuit curve simulation per proof.

**The decider is reachable and refuses.** With the tail entry carrying the UltraHonk recursion vk
(3,680 bytes) rather than the chonk vk (5,216), the run advances to
`ChonkProve - generating proof for 4 accumulated circuits` and then asserts:

```
op_queue->get_current_subtable_size() == HIDING_KERNEL_ULTRA_OPS
Actual: 0   Expected: 331
Number of ultra ops in the hiding kernel doesn't match the expected value.
```

So the scheme requires a **hiding kernel** as the final circuit in the stack, with a specific op count.
That is an Aztec protocol circuit, part of their transaction structure, and we do not have it.
`withdraw_identity` cannot stand in for it.

**What this settles and what it does not.** Chonk is not a general accumulator for an arbitrary stack
of one application circuit; it expects Aztec's kernel shape. The decider's cost, which is the figure
that decides whether folding solves the batcher problem or relocates it, is therefore still
unmeasured. Everything cheap has been measured; the expensive half has not.

**Round budget, worth recording.** Stacks of 8 and above hit `round_number < 256U`, exactly 256 with
16 circuits, so the transcript budgets 16 rounds per circuit. Four circuits stay inside it. That caps
a naive stack at fewer than 16 regardless of anything else.

- [ ] To measure the decider we need either Aztec's hiding kernel circuit, or a folding implementation
      that does not assume their transaction structure. Until one of those exists this line of work
      cannot be finished, and the batcher's 21.7 GB stands.

### 2.18ds Batch sizes are fixed per circuit, and the multi-prover choice (user, 2026-08-04)

**A batch is always exactly the circuit's N.** `BatchVerifierLib.verifyBatch` permits
`signals.length < maxBatch`, but no proof can satisfy it: the commitment fold is length-binding and the
circuit folds exactly `BATCH_N`. A depth-2 tree means 256 exactly. Anything short requires the batcher
to pad with dummy withdrawals they prove themselves, paying full proving cost for empty slots.

**Two sizes can coexist safely.** Deploy the depth-1 verifier and the depth-2 root verifier and choose
per batch. Both are Honk against the same SRS, so the second adds no trust assumption. This is the
difference from putting Groth16 beside Honk, where the pool drops to the weaker verifier for everyone.

**The user-facing shape.** At deposit the user either registers interest in a batch or leaves it open.
Choosing to wait buys cheaper gas and a guaranteed timing cohort. Choosing not to wait means an
immediate single withdrawal at full price. The default should be waiting, so the yield floor and the
cohort are what happens unless someone opts out.

- [ ] Wire elect-to-wait at deposit: a queue the batcher serves, with the immediate path as the
      deliberate alternative rather than the default.
- [ ] Decide which fixed sizes to run. 16 fills sooner and saves less; 256 saves 12x more and will not
      fill early. Running both is allowed and costs one extra verifier deployment.
- [ ] The multi-prover choice (2.18do) sits on top of this, and its blocker is the ceremony rather than
      the plumbing.

### 2.18dq Folding measured as far as it goes: accumulation is ~57x cheaper, the decider is still unmeasured (2026-08-04)

Ran `bb prove -s chonk` over sixteen real `withdraw_identity` instances. The accumulation phase works
and is dramatically cheaper than our recursive aggregator. The run then fails before the decider, so
the number that actually decides the question is still missing.

| | recursive aggregator (2.18dk) | chonk folding |
|---|---|---|
| peak memory, 16 instances | ~21.7 GB (12,465 MiB resident + ~9.2 GB swap) | **377 MB** |
| wall clock to that point | 280,492 ms for the proving key alone | 3.56 s |
| result | proof, verified on-chain | assertion failure before completion |

The log shows it loading and accumulating all sixteen at a flat 359 MiB, so the fold itself is doing
what ProtoGalaxy promises: each incremental step is cheap, with no in-circuit curve simulation per
proof.

**Where it stops.** `Assertion failed: (round_number < 256U)`, hit after the sixteenth accumulation.
The likely cause is structural rather than a size limit. ClientIVC is built for Aztec's transaction
shape, which alternates application circuits with kernel circuits, and we handed it sixteen identical
application circuits and nothing else. So chonk is not a drop-in accumulator for an arbitrary stack of
the same circuit.

**What this does and does not tell us.** It establishes that the per-instance cost collapses, which is
the part that makes a batcher a server. It does not establish the decider's cost, and the decider is
where the commitment openings finally get checked, so it is the number that decides whether folding
solves the problem or relocates it. If the decider lands near one verification's worth (~800k gates)
folding wins outright. If it lands near 12.7M, the cost has moved rather than gone.

**Format notes, since they cost an hour and are not documented anywhere obvious.** The input is
msgpack, an array of maps with keys `bytecode`, `witness`, `vk` and `functionName`. The vk must be the
**chonk flavour** (5,216 bytes via `bb write_vk -s chonk`), not the UltraHonk recursion vk (3,680
bytes) the aggregator pins. Fewer than four circuits is rejected outright:
`num_circuits >= 4` because `get_queue_type` uses `num_circuits - 3`.

- [ ] Work out the app/kernel structure chonk expects, or find whether a plain stack is supported at
      all, then reach the decider and measure it. That single figure decides the batcher question and
      whether the retired STARK argument returns.

### 2.18do Two withdrawal paths, and what stands between us and them (user, 2026-08-04)

Decision from the repo owner: ship both provers and let the withdrawer choose. Instant via Groth16 at
~213,882 gas, or batched via Honk at 186,255 for N=16 and roughly 15k if the depth-2 tree ever runs.
Neither path alone covers the product, because the tree only pays at 256 and 256 will not fill early,
while someone will always want out now.

**The contract side is close to free.** `WITHDRAWAL_VERIFIER` is a single immutable behind
`INoirVerifier.verify(bytes, bytes32[])`, so a dispatcher reading a tag on the proof bytes routes to
either verifier. `PrivacyPool`, `State`, `ProofLib` and every guard stay untouched. Both circuits expose
the same seven signals because they compile from one Noir source, so nothing is authored twice.

**Coexistence costs a soundness property, and it is bounded by ceremony quality.** A pool accepts a
withdrawal if any accepted verifier says yes, so its security is that of the weakest one. A broken
Groth16 setup drains the pool including funds of users who only ever produced Honk proofs, because the
attacker picks the path. Value caps do not help, since a forger repeats. Note the baseline is not zero:
the Honk path already rests on Aztec's ignition SRS, which we neither ran nor can audit. So this moves
us from one ceremony assumption to two, and it breaks if either fails.

**The ceremony is the real obstacle, and it is social rather than technical.** Mechanically it is
snarkjs and a public powers-of-tau file, and only phase two is ours. Credibility is the hard part. A
setup is sound if one contributor destroyed their entropy, so the argument rests entirely on
independence, which needs numbers. Tornado's had over a thousand contributors and pseudonymity was fine
there because the strength came from the spread. Five anonymous contributors are indistinguishable from
one person with five machines. Getting to a thousand needs an audience a young protocol may not have,
and that is a stronger argument for staying on Honk than any gas figure in this file, since on Honk we
are inheriting a ceremony run by people with the reach to attract participants.

**Three integration seams, and only one of them fails quietly.**
1. ACIR to R1CS via `noir-gnark`. R1CS has no lookup tables, so range checks expand. **If the
   translation drops a constraint the circuit still proves and still verifies while accepting witnesses
   it should reject, and nothing announces it.** This is the one that needs adversarial testing rather
   than a happy-path check.
2. Key format. gnark writes its own; rapidsnark, the proven mobile prover, reads snarkjs format. Fails
   loudly, at parse time.
3. Witness ordering. Ours comes from Noir's ACVM in Noir's layout; a Groth16 prover wants R1CS order.
   Fails loudly, as a proof that does not verify.

**On-device proving is unproven.** `noir-gnark` is pure Go with no FFI, and Go runs on both platforms
through gomobile, but nobody has shown it proving a circuit this size on ARM. The alternative is
rapidsnark, which reaches us only across seams 2 and 3.

**Sequencing, and the ceremony goes last.**
- [ ] Prototype the translation and on-device proving with a **throwaway single-contributor key**,
      treated as insecure and never deployed. This answers whether ACIR translates, the R1CS constraint
      count against 44,176 gates, proving time on a phone, and zkey size, which drives app size and
      cannot be derived on device.
- [ ] Test the translated circuit adversarially. Witnesses that must fail, confirmed failing. Seam 1 is
      silent otherwise.
- [ ] Freeze the withdrawal circuit before the real ceremony. Every revision needs a new one, and this
      repo has moved through four Noir betas with proof formats shifting underneath it. A thousand
      people contribute once.
- [ ] Only then the ceremony, with open contribution, published transcript, and a final random beacon.
- [ ] Dispatcher and wallet path selection last. Worthless without the above.
- [ ] Keep the batched Honk path as the default, so the yield floor and the timing cohort are what
      happens unless a user opts out.

**Two things that are not affected.** Deposits verify no proof at all, so Groth16 does nothing for
them; the ~265k is Poseidon hashing up the tree plus storage, and reducing it is a data-structure
question. And a second Honk verifier, such as a depth-2 root, adds no new trust assumption, so running
N=16 and N=256 side by side is safe in a way that Honk beside Groth16 is not.

### 2.18dp The batcher as a standing target (user, 2026-08-04)

The design already answers forgery and censorship. The inner verification key is pinned as a circuit
constant, batching is permissionless with no registry or stake, and a user refused by every batcher
self-submits at full gas, so refusal costs money rather than access.

What it does not answer is concentration. A batcher needs ~21.7 GB and minutes of proving per batch,
which is a rented server with an account behind it. Permissionless in the contract does not produce
plurality when entry looks like that, and one operator who is replaceable in principle is still one
operator in practice.

There is metadata exposure too. A batcher receives sixteen proofs and their seven public signals,
including the nullifier, the withdrawn value, and the context encoding the recipient. The link back to
a deposit stays hidden, so this is not a break, but an operator who logs builds a withdrawal-pattern
dataset that a subpoena reaches. An on-chain observer sees the same fields later, so the exposure is
timing and grouping.

Folding therefore matters for decentralisation and not only for cost. If proving drops to something a
laptop does in seconds, batching stops being a business and becomes something a participant does
incidentally while submitting their own withdrawal, which is the state where there is nothing to raid.
Whether folding reaches that depends on the decider's cost, which is unmeasured.

- [ ] Measure the folding decider against the recursive baseline in 2.18dk. It decides whether the
      batcher role can be diffuse.

### 2.18dn COSTING GROTH16 FOR WITHDRAWALS - and it would make the aggregator redundant (user, 2026-08-04)

*"what would be the cost of bringing back groth for withdrawals?"* Costed against the actual code, and
the striking part is not the cost - it is what it DELETES.

**CONTRACT SIDE: ONE ADAPTER, AND NOTHING ELSE CHANGES.** The withdrawal verifier is a
constructor-injected address behind `INoirVerifier.verify(bytes proof, bytes32[] publicInputs)`
(`PrivacyPool` ctor -> `State`). `ProofLib.WithdrawProof` already carries the proof as **`bytes`**, not
as Groth16's `(a, b, c)` tuple - so a small adapter that decodes those bytes and calls a snarkjs/gnark
verifier satisfies the interface. **`PrivacyPool`, `State`, `ProofLib` and every guard stay untouched.**

**WHAT ACTUALLY COSTS SOMETHING:**
| piece | cost | risk |
|---|---|---|
| Groth16-provable `withdraw_identity` | ACIR -> gnark (`noir-gnark`) keeps ONE Noir source; a Circom rewrite does not | **the real risk** - backend is young/unverified |
| trusted setup | reuse a public Powers of Tau + phase 2 for ONE circuit (44,176 gates), snarkjs-tooled | low - secure if ANY participant is honest, and **we** run it |
| verifier contract | generated, ~1,736 bytes | none |
| adapter | small | none |
| wallet prover | add rapidsnark/gnark beside barretenberg | moderate - app size, second toolchain |

**"HOW COULD WE TRUST THEIR CEREMONIES" - WE WOULD NOT.** The objection to Groth16 was never that
ceremonies are untrustworthy; it is that **79 passport profiles means 79 ceremonies**, which we cannot
run, so we would inherit rarimo's. **One circuit is one ceremony, run publicly by us.** That is the
whole asymmetry, and it is why the hybrid is coherent where a full port was not.

**AND HERE IS THE PART THAT MATTERS MOST: IT MAKES THE AGGREGATOR REDUNDANT.**
Groth16 single = **~213,882**. A PERFECTLY FILLED Honk batch of 16 = **186,255**. The aggregator's
entire apparatus buys **13%** over simply not needing it. So adopting Groth16 for withdrawals would let
us delete:
- `aggregate_withdrawals` + `AggregationHonkVerifier` (2^24 circuit, 12.7M gates)
- `BatchVerifierLib`, `BatchCommitmentLib`, `withdrawBatch` and its guards
- **the batcher role entirely** - no ~21.7 GB machine, no relay-fee economics, no liveness dependency
- the fill/latency problem, the "register interest in a batch" UX, and the depth-2 tree question

**That is the largest reduction in moving parts available anywhere in this repo**, and it costs 13%
against a batch that must be FULL to achieve its number - while a Groth16 single needs no fill at all.

- [ ] Prototype `noir-gnark` on `withdraw_identity` FIRST. Everything else is routine; this is the
      only step that can fail. If ACIR does not translate, the hybrid dies and the aggregator stays.
- [ ] Do NOT build the depth-2 tree until this is decided - it is 256-slot fill for a saving the
      hybrid gets without any fill.

### 2.18dm AGGREGATION IS A THROUGHPUT WIN, NOT A PER-WITHDRAWAL ONE - and Groth16 wins the thin case (user, 2026-08-04)

*"it's only if there 16 at a time that the cost per one is reduced... we shouldnt have removed groth?"*
**Both halves are right, and the second is the more interesting one.**

**THE BATCH COST IS FIXED, SO FILL DECIDES EVERYTHING.** `BATCH_N` is compile-time, so a batch proof
costs **2,980,094 gas whether it carries 1 real withdrawal or 16**:

| real withdrawals in the batch | gas each | vs settling singly (2,528,007) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2,980,094 | **WORSE** |
| 2 | 1,490,047 | better |
| 16 | 186,255 | 13.6x better |

**Break-even is TWO.** One-at-a-time aggregation is a net loss, and nothing in the system currently
decides between the two paths.

**AND PARTIAL BATCHES CANNOT ACTUALLY WORK.** `BatchVerifierLib.verifyBatch` permits
`signals.length < maxBatch`, but no proof can satisfy it: the commitment fold is LENGTH-BINDING and
the circuit folds exactly 16, so a 5-signal call computes a commitment no proof carries. **The guard
implies a capability that does not exist.** A batcher must always pad to 16 - generating real
`withdraw_identity` proofs for empty slots - and pays the same ~21.7 GB either way, so cost per PAYING
withdrawal explodes at low fill. The gas saving converts into LATENCY.

**WHICH IS EXACTLY WHERE GROTH16 WINS, AND THE NUMBERS ARE NOW MEASURED:**

| | gas |
|---|---|
| **Groth16 verification** (ecPairing 4 pairs 181,132 + 5x ecMul 6,130 + overhead) | **~213,882** |
| Honk **single** withdrawal | 2,528,007 - **11.8x more** |
| Honk **batch of 16**, per withdrawal | 186,255 - only **13% cheaper than a Groth16 single** |

**READ THAT LAST ROW AGAIN.** A FULL 16-batch on Honk barely beats a plain Groth16 single. So the
hybrid the user proposes is strong: **Groth16 for the withdrawal (ONE circuit, ONE ceremony, ~214k
always, no fill requirement), Honk for passport registration (79 profiles, zero ceremonies)** - which
is where the ceremony argument actually bites. The withdrawal circuit is 44,176 gates; a ceremony for
one small circuit is not the 79 we refused.

**AND IT NEED NOT MEAN TWO CIRCUIT LANGUAGES.** `YaniXIV/noir-gnark` translates ACIR to gnark, which
does Groth16 - so ONE Noir source could emit both. Unverified and young, but the shape is right and it
is the same ACIR-portability argument as 2.18dh.

**A MEASUREMENT FAILURE WORTH KEEPING.** The first attempt called a real Groth16 verifier with a fake
proof and read **1,040,429,520 gas** - because snarkjs verifiers answer an invalid proof with
`invalid()`, which burns all remaining gas. "Constant-time verification" is true of the ALGORITHM and
false of the CONTRACT. The figure above is priced from the precompiles instead (EIP-1108 prices by
input size, not by result).

- [ ] Fix `verifyBatch`'s unreachable `signals.length < maxBatch` branch - require a full batch, or
      make padding explicit. A guard that cannot pass misleads whoever reads it next.
- [ ] Decide the FILL POLICY: settle singly below 2 pending, batch above. Nothing does this today.
- [ ] Price the hybrid seriously: Groth16 withdrawal (one ceremony) + Honk registration. On the thin
      case it is ~11.8x, and even a full batch only beats it by 13%.
- [ ] Note the tension with the depth-2 tree (2.18dl): 256 slots make fill HARDER, so the tree pays
      only at high steady volume - exactly when Groth16's advantage is smallest.

### 2.18dl THE AGGREGATION ECONOMICS, MEASURED ON-CHAIN AT LAST (2026-08-04)

Every gas figure for aggregation in this file was an ESTIMATE. With a real proof in hand they are now
measured, with `verify()` isolated - no fixture parsing, no settlement:

| | measured |
|---|---|
| single withdrawal `verify()` | **2,528,007** |
| aggregated batch of 16, whole call | **2,980,094** |
| **per withdrawal at N=16** | **186,255** |
| **saving** | **13.6x** |

**CORRECTIONS TO THIS FILE'S OWN NUMBERS:**
- sec. 2.4's *"~68k gas/withdrawal at N=16"* is **wrong by 2.7x** - it is 186k.
- The circuit header's *"~152,846"* is close: measured is **22% higher**.
- sec. 2.4's *"~200k+ single-proof verification"* understates by **12x** - a single verify is 2.53M,
  which is what makes the ~3.1M whole-withdrawal figure add up.

**THE SCALABILITY LEVER, AND IT IS ALREADY DESIGNED (sec. 2.4b's 16-wide tree).** Honk verification
cost depends on the circuit's shape, not on N, and a depth-2 tree keeps every node at N=16 - so the
TOP proof stays the same 2.98M call while covering **256** withdrawals:

| batching | verify gas / withdrawal | + signal calldata | total |
|---|---|---|---|
| none | 2,528,007 | 3,584 | ~2.53M |
| N=16 (built, proven, verified on-chain) | 186,255 | 3,584 | ~190k |
| **N=256 (tree depth 2, UNBUILT)** | **~11,641** | 3,584 | **~15k** |

**That is a further 12x, and it needs no new cryptography** - only the tree the design already
specifies. It is the single largest efficiency item left.

**AND ONE CALLDATA CORRECTION.** sec. 2.4 says *"N=256 means keccak over ~57 KB of calldata = ~11k gas
for the whole batch"*. The **keccak** is ~11k; the **CALLDATA ITSELF** is ~57 KB at 16 gas/non-zero
byte = **~917k gas**, ~80x the figure quoted beside it. Still only ~3.6k per withdrawal, so the
conclusion survives - but the number as written is not the cost of the calldata, and someone sizing a
batch from it would be badly wrong.

- [ ] Build the depth-2 tree (N=256). Largest measured efficiency win available, no new primitives.
- [ ] Consider EIP-4844 blobs for the signal calldata at large N - at N=256 signals are ~917k gas, the
      dominant term once verification is amortised.

### 2.18dk THE N=16 BASELINE, MEASURED END-TO-END ON THE CURRENT PIN (2026-08-04)

**The recursive aggregator works on beta.26 + bb 5.1.0.** TODO recorded the end-to-end run only on
beta.13 + bb 1.2.0; it has now been reproduced on the current toolchain, with 16 REAL inner proofs.

| step | measured |
|---|---|
| inner proof (`withdraw_identity`, `-t noir-recursive`) | 458 proof fields, 7 public inputs - **exactly `PROOF_LEN`/`PUB_LEN`** |
| **pinned inner VK** | **all 115 fields match a freshly generated VK** - the pin is CURRENT, not stale |
| aggregation witness | solved with 16 real proofs; batch commitment matched |
| `write_vk` | peak **12,214 MiB** |
| `bb prove -t evm` | proving key **280,492 ms**, peak **12,465 MiB** resident + ~9.2 GB swap = **~21.7 GB** |
| `bb verify -t evm` | **Proof verified successfully** |
| circuit size | **12,720,801 gates** (the recorded 11.6M is stale - it grew) |
| outer proof | 370 fields, 1 public input |

**WHERE THE COST ACTUALLY SITS - the differential, because it decides the folding question.**
Compiling the same circuit at `BATCH_N=2` gives **1,546,283** gates. So:

> **(12,720,801 - 1,546,283) / 14 = ~798,180 gates per additional in-circuit verification**

**~91% of the circuit is the sixteen recursive UltraHonk verifications.** That is precisely the
non-native curve arithmetic that STARK/FRI recursion avoids, and it confirms the diagnosis rather than
assuming it.

**WHAT THIS MEANS FOR FOLDING (2.18dj), stated as a falsifiable prediction BEFORE the run:**
folding relocates this cost rather than deleting it - the accumulator still has to be discharged by a
**decider**, and the decider is where the commitment openings are finally checked. So the honest claim
is *"folding replaces N in-circuit verifications with ONE, and makes the incremental step nearly
free"*, not *"folding removes recursion cost"*.

> **THE NUMBER TO READ OFF THE FOLDING RUN IS THE DECIDER'S GATE COUNT AND PEAK MEMORY, NOT THE
> FOLDING STEPS.** Prediction: if the decider lands near **~800k gates** (one verification's worth),
> folding wins by ~16x and the batcher stops needing a server. **If it lands near 12.7M, the problem
> has been MOVED, not solved** - and then the STARK argument returns with a measurement behind it,
> because FRI verification is hash-based and avoids exactly this term.

- [x] Run `bb prove -s chonk --ivc_inputs_path <16-instance stack>` and record **decider gate count and
      peak RSS**. Compare against 12,720,801 / ~21.7 GB. **Done, see 2.18ea: 572 MB peak against
      ~21.7 GB, and the proof is the same size at N=4 and N=16.** The STARK argument does not come
      back on cost; what remains is the EVM hop, which is a different axis entirely.
- [ ] Minor: `BATCH_N=1` fails to compile (N=2 and N=16 are fine) - unexamined, and it would make the
      slope measurement cleaner.
- [ ] Minor: `inner_vk.nr`'s header says "112 field elements"; it is **115**. Stale comment.

### 2.18dj FOLDING ATTACKS THE 28 GB WITHOUT LEAVING THE STACK - and `bb` already ships it (user, 2026-08-04)

*"Aztec built ProtoGalaxy and ClientIVC precisely so a client folds many proofs without a full
recursive verification per step."* **Correct, and it reframes the whole STARK discussion.**

**WHAT OUR AGGREGATOR DOES TODAY.** `aggregate_withdrawals/src/main.nr:157` calls
`std::verify_proof_with_type` **once per proof, inside the circuit** - a FULL in-circuit UltraHonk
verification, ~725k gates each. Sixteen of them is the 11.6M gates and the ~27-28 GB. **The cost is
the architecture, not the proving system:** we chose recursive verification, and folding is the
alternative that Aztec built for exactly this.

**AND IT IS IN OUR PINNED TOOLCHAIN, UNUSED.** `bb 5.1.0` exposes:
```
-s,--scheme [BB_SCHEME]   Options: {chonk, avm, ultra_honk}
--ivc_inputs_path         For IVC, path to input stack with bytecode and witnesses
```
`chonk` is the folding/ClientIVC scheme (the `check` subcommand's help even refers to "the VKs in the
folding stack"). So this needs **no new backend, no forked compiler, no re-audit of a different
proving system, and no decision about already-anchored state** - which is what every STARK option
costs.

**THE ONE CATCH, AND IT IS SHAPED LIKE AZTEC'S OWN DESIGN:** `write_solidity_verifier` only targets
`evm`/`evm-no-zk` against an **UltraHonk** VK. A ClientIVC/Chonk proof is therefore NOT directly
EVM-verifiable; it needs a final UltraHonk wrap - one full recursive verification of the folded
accumulator, ONCE per batch instead of sixteen times. **That is precisely the trade that makes it
worth doing**, and it is how Aztec's own client-side proving reaches L1.

**SO THE HONEST RANKING OF WAYS TO FIX THE BATCHER CHANGES:**
1. **Fold with `chonk`, wrap once in UltraHonk.** In-stack, in the pinned `bb`, no migration. **Should
   be tried before anything else.**
2. Keep recursive verification and accept ~28 GB.
3. Migrate to a STARK backend - the option I spent this session pricing, and the most expensive one.

**WHICH ALSO WEAKENS 2.18di's LOSS #3.** "Expensive recursion" is a property of the aggregator we WROTE,
not of Honk. If folding lands, the batcher's hardware requirement stops being an argument for STARKs at
all - and that was the last surviving cryptographic argument (gas died in 2.18dg, post-quantum in
2.18di's correction, "no circuits to inherit" in 2.18dh).

- [ ] Prototype `bb prove -s chonk --ivc_inputs_path <stack>` over 16 `withdraw_identity` instances and
      measure peak RSS against the recursive aggregator's ~27-28 GB. **This is the highest-value
      unstarted measurement in the repo** - it is cheap, in-stack, and it decides whether the batcher
      needs a server at all.
- [ ] Then price the final UltraHonk wrap of the folded accumulator (one recursive verification, not
      sixteen) and confirm the existing Solidity verifier shape still applies.

### 2.18di WHAT STAYING FULLY NOIR ACTUALLY COSTS (user, 2026-08-04)

Four losses, in descending order of how much they should worry anyone. All numbers measured in this
repo unless marked.

> **2.18di's LOSS #1 IS LARGELY WRONG - corrected 2026-08-04 on the repo owner's challenge.** Two
> errors. **(a) A quantum adversary does not need to break Honk.** All **79 of 79** live profiles

> genuinely sticky is DEPLOYED VERIFIERS and ALREADY-ANCHORED STATE - whether the existing identity
> tree is re-attested - not source code. Read the paragraph below with both corrections applied.

**1. POST-QUANTUM. The only loss that cannot be undone later.** Honk over BN254 rests on elliptic-curve
assumptions; a cryptographically relevant quantum computer breaks SOUNDNESS - forged proofs, i.e.
fabricated passport registrations. STARKs are hash-based and plausibly post-quantum. This is a real
loss and it is the one nobody can fix by swapping a backend at the last minute, because every proof
verified on-chain before the switch was verified under the broken assumption. **Not urgent; not
reversible either.**

**2. A TRUSTED SETUP WE DO NOT NEED TO HAVE.** We keep a universal SRS. STARKs are transparent - zero
setup, no toxic waste. **But this loss is smaller than it looks on-chain:** Plonky2 has no EVM verifier,
so the standard practice is to wrap it in a SNARK, which reintroduces a setup. For EVM verification the
practical difference may be nil; for off-chain verification it is real.

**3. RECURSION IS EXPENSIVE FOR US, AND IT IS MEASURED.** Verifying a Honk proof inside a circuit means
simulating curve arithmetic: our aggregation circuit is **11,610,552 gates for 16 proofs, ~725k gates
per inner verification**, and the batcher needs **~28 GB and minutes**. Plonky2 recursion is hash-based
and materially cheaper. This is an **economic** loss, not a correctness one - it lands on the batcher,
who is paid from the relay fee - but it sets how decentralised batching can be. A ~28 GB requirement is
a server, and servers are fewer than laptops.

**4. WE DO NOT LOSE ON EVM GAS - we WIN.** Honk verification is ~490k single, **~68k per withdrawal at
N=16**. A raw STARK is 1-5M per batch. Staying Noir is the CHEAPER on-chain option, and any claim that
STARKs would save gas here is backwards.

**AND THE DECISIVE COMPENSATION: THE CHOICE IS REVERSIBLE.** Because `nargo` emits **ACIR**, not a
barretenberg artifact (2.18dh: 42 MB of it in a single compiled circuit), the circuits are not married
to Honk. If `acvm-backend-plonky2` or a successor matures, **the same sources retarget it** - the
exotic crypto is Noir, not blackboxes. A Circom/Groth16 or Halo2 choice would NOT have been reversible:
those are circuit languages, and switching means rewriting.

**So the honest summary: staying fully Noir costs post-quantum soundness and a cheaper batcher, keeps
the on-chain cost advantage, and preserves the option to move later at the cost of re-verifying, not
re-writing.** The one loss to take seriously is #1, and the correct response is to know the date by
which it matters rather than to switch now on a 14-month-stale backend.

- [ ] Revisit annually, not continuously, and revisit on EVIDENCE: (a) does `acvm-backend-plonky2` or a
      successor load current ACIR; (b) has a Plonky2 EVM verifier landed that does not need a SNARK
      wrapper. Both are yes/no questions, cheap to re-ask.

### 2.18dh TESTING THE STARK PATH AS FAR AS THIS MACHINE ALLOWS - and "no rewrite" is mostly RIGHT (user, 2026-08-04)

*"do the best you can to test STARK right now... we wouldnt have to write circuits from scratch with
stark right?"* Tested to the limit of what can be run here, and **the claim holds better than I said.**

**1. ACIR IS GENUINELY PORTABLE, CONFIRMED.** `nargo compile` emits ACIR, not a barretenberg artifact:
our compiled circuit carries **42 MB of decompressed ACIR** in `bytecode` (gzip+base64). The circuits
are not written against Honk.

**2. AN ACIR STARK BACKEND EXISTS.** `eryxcoop/acvm-backend-plonky2` - Plonky2, open source, last
pushed 2025-06-04. So the interface has a second implementation, which is what "no rewrite" requires.

**3. AND THE SURFACE WE NEED IS SMALL - THIS IS THE PART I HAD WRONG.** I claimed a STARK move means
implementing RSA, eight ECDSA curves and four hash functions in a backend. **It does not, because
rarimo implemented them IN NOIR rather than as blackboxes:**

| primitive | where it lives | portable? |
|---|---|---|
| SHA-1 / 224 / 384 / 512 | `noir_dl_lib/src/sha{1,224,384,512}.nr` - **Noir source** | **yes** |
| RSA bignum, ECDSA over 8 curves | Noir + Brillig (`__compute_quadratic_expression_with_borrow_flags`, `__invmod`, `get_wnaf_slices2`) | **yes** |
| Poseidon | the `poseidon` Noir crate, 19 call sites | **yes** |
| the only real blackbox demands | RANGE, AND, XOR, `sha256_compression`, BrilligCall, MemoryOp | **all listed as implemented** by the Plonky2 backend |

**So the blackbox set our circuits actually require is nearly exactly what that backend already
supports.** The "you would be writing a backend instead of circuits" objection is much weaker than I
stated it.

**WHAT I COULD NOT RUN, AND WHY - stated so nobody reads this as a green light:**
- It needs a **FORKED NOIR** (`brweisz/noir`), not stock nargo, and was last touched **14 months
  before** our pinned beta.26. ACIR has changed across that gap; whether our artifacts even load is
  unknown.
- Building it is a Rust + Plonky2 nightly build of a forked compiler - hours, not minutes, and it
  proves nothing about correctness on our circuits without a witness we do not have.
- **RANGE is capped at 33 bits** in that backend. Our bignum decomposes into limbs, so this may be
  fine or may be fatal; **it is the single cheapest thing to check next.**
- **Plonky2 has no EVM verifier.** On-chain it needs a SNARK wrapper - which reintroduces a trusted
  setup, one instead of many, i.e. exactly what the universal SRS already gives us.

**REVISED CONCLUSION.** Of the three reasons I gave for Honk over STARKs, **gas died to aggregation
(2.18dg), and "no circuits to inherit" is now largely dead too.** What survives is thinner than
claimed: an unverified on-device memory question, a 14-month-stale experimental backend needing a
forked compiler, and the EVM-verification wrapper. **That is a maturity argument, not a cryptographic
one** - and maturity arguments expire.

- [ ] Cheapest decisive test, in order: (a) does our ACIR load in that backend at all, given the
      version gap; (b) is the 33-bit RANGE cap fatal to our bignum limbs. Both are hours, not weeks.
- [ ] Do NOT restate "we would rewrite every circuit" - measured false. The circuits are Noir; the
      exotic crypto is Noir; only a handful of opcodes are backend-provided.

### 2.18dg "BUT WE DO AGGREGATION" - the gas argument against STARKs does not survive it (user, 2026-08-04)

**The challenge lands, and the argument I gave was the weakest one.** I rejected STARKs on EVM
verification cost (~1-5M gas). Aggregation amortises exactly that:

| | on-chain cost |
|---|---|
| single Honk proof | ~200k+ |
| **Honk at N=16** | **~68k / withdrawal** |
| a STARK batch proof at 1-5M, over 16 | **62k - 312k / withdrawal** |

So a STARK stack BRACKETS our figure rather than being disqualified by it, and both shrink further as
N grows. **Gas is not the discriminator once you aggregate** - and STARKs recurse at least as well as
Honk (Plonky2's whole design is recursion), so the aggregation itself is not the obstacle either.

**WHAT ACTUALLY SURVIVES, in order of strength:**
1. **ON-DEVICE PROVING.** Users prove their OWN withdrawal on a phone in ~1.3 s, and the witness never
   leaves. That is the design's privacy property, not a convenience. STARK proving is memory-hungry,
   and the passport circuits run 2^18-2^25; a phone is the binding constraint, not a server.
2. **NOTHING TO INHERIT.** rarimo publishes **Noir**. A STARK stack means authoring ~92 circuits
   (79 passport + 10 light + PP's 3) from scratch with no upstream to diff against - and today's light
   work is the counter-example: ten verifiers regenerated from a template in minutes, with correctness
   proven by a VK collision against the existing artifact.
3. **THE TRUST WIN IS SMALLER THAN IT LOOKS.** A raw STARK verified on-chain at 1-5M per batch is
   plausible; the standard practice (RISC Zero, Polygon) is to WRAP the STARK in a SNARK for EVM
   verification - which reintroduces a trusted setup. One ceremony instead of 92, which is exactly
   what the universal SRS already gives us.

**SO THE CONCLUSION HOLDS BUT THE REASONING CHANGES:** STARKs were not ruled out by gas. They are
ruled out by on-device proving and by having no circuits to inherit. Anyone revisiting this should
attack THOSE two, and should note that #1 is measurable today (prove a 2^18 passport circuit on
phone-class hardware) rather than a matter of opinion.

- [ ] If the on-device constraint ever relaxes (server-side proving, or a delegated prover that does
      not see the witness), reason 1 disappears and this decision genuinely reopens. Record it then
      rather than treating the stack as settled forever.

### 2.18de WHICH AXIS DECIDES: SOUNDNESS vs COST, and 1 assumption vs 79 (user, 2026-08-04)

*"but this doesnt need a ceremony? which axis is better? why does it matter?"*

**FIRST, A CORRECTION: UltraHonk DOES need a ceremony.** It is not transparent. What it does not need
is a **PER-CIRCUIT** one - it uses a UNIVERSAL SRS (the ~2 GiB CRS the Docker build downloads once and
caches in a named volume). Saying "no ceremony" would overstate it; the accurate claim is **one shared
setup instead of one per circuit.**

**THE TWO AXES, measured here:**

| | Groth16 | Honk | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| verifier runtime size | 1,736 B | 18,430 B | **10.6x** |
| verification gas | ~200-250k | **~490k** (measured, `WithdrawalHonkVerifier.t.sol`) | **~2x** |
| trusted setups needed for 79 shapes | **79** | **1, already done** | - |

**WHY THE SETUP AXIS DECIDES IT, and it is not close:**

1. **IT IS A SOUNDNESS AXIS; THE OTHER IS A COST AXIS.** If a ceremony's toxic waste is retained,
   whoever holds it can FORGE PROOFS for that circuit - fabricate a passport registration, and every
   downstream check (PP admission, notary enrolment, title) inherits the lie. Gas is money you pay.
   **A forged-proof capability is neither detectable on-chain nor reversible.**
2. **79 ASSUMPTIONS versus 1.** Each circuit shape needs its own ceremony, so Groth16 here means 79
   independent chances for one to be done badly - and a compromise in any single one is enough.
3. **AND WE COULD NOT RUN THEM.** In practice Groth16 means trusting **rarimo's** 79 ceremonies: a
   third party whose toxic waste we cannot verify was destroyed. **That is precisely the shape this
   session has spent itself deleting** - the postman, the controller, the backend signer. Removing
   four trusted parties and then accepting 79 unverifiable ceremonies would be incoherent.
4. **The universal SRS is the better assumption even where it is still an assumption**: one public,
   large multi-party ceremony shared by the whole ecosystem, so it is scrutinised by everyone and its
   compromise would be a global event rather than a silent local one.

**WHAT THE COST AXIS ACTUALLY COSTS US:** ~2x verification gas per proof, and 10.6x contract size -
which is one-time at deploy and solvable by splitting verifiers. **Both are payable. The other is
not.** That is the whole argument.

**AND IT DOES NOT JUSTIFY 79 SHAPES** (2.18dd): the setup argument defends the PROVING SYSTEM, not
rarimo's per-profile circuit design. Size classes would cut the verifier count without touching this
trade.

### 2.18dd IT WAS NEVER THE STACK - it is PER-PROFILE SPECIALISATION (user, 2026-08-04)

*"so the right move was actually to rewrite rarimo to be on the same stack as PP?"* **The instinct is
right and the diagnosis needs one correction: rarimo IS already on PP's stack.** Both are Noir /
UltraHonk. What differs is circuit DESIGN, and the gap is enormous:

| | stack | verifiers needed |
|---|---|---|
| PP (`contracts/pool/verifiers/`) | Noir / UltraHonk | **3** |
| rarimo passport (`verifiers2/noir/`) | Noir / UltraHonk | **79** |

**26x, on the same proving system.** PP writes circuits whose SHAPE DOES NOT VARY PER USER. rarimo
bakes each document's array lengths in as compile-time generics, so every combination of
`DG1_LEN/EC_LEN/SA_LEN/N` is a different circuit and therefore a different verifier.

**AND THAT SINGLE CHOICE CAUSES EVERY PROBLEM THIS SESSION SPENT ITSELF ON:**
- the six orphans and the whole `EC_LEN` hunt (2.18cy/2.18da) - `EC_LEN` only matters because it is
  COMPILE-TIME;
- 82 artifacts to recover, a manifest to maintain, 7 quietly missing (2.18cz), one degenerate;
- three profiles that needed 33 GiB working sets to build (2.18-swap);
- much of the EIP-170 pressure, at 18,430 bytes per verifier (2.18dc).
None of it is inherent to Honk. **PP proves the same stack does not have to work this way.**

**THE ALTERNATIVE, AND ITS REAL COST.** One circuit with arrays padded to a MAXIMUM and the true
length passed as a witness collapses 79 into ~1. The price is that every proof pays the worst case: a
simple RSA-2048/SHA-1 passport costs what RSA-4096/SHA-512 costs. **Proving happens ON A PHONE**, so
that is a real UX cost, and it is presumably why rarimo specialised.

**THE MIDDLE GROUND NOBODY HAS PRICED: SIZE CLASSES.** Three to five circuits covering ranges rather
than 79 exact shapes. Keeps proving within a small factor of optimal and deletes the manifest, the
orphans, the recovery problem and most of the EIP-170 pressure at once.

- [x] **ANSWERED by 2.18df: five classes, 2^18 to 2^25 = 128x.** No proving run needed; each verifier declares its own circuitSize. Superseded: measure proving time for the smallest profile against the largest, on
      phone-class hardware. If the ratio is small, the per-profile model is pure cost and the whole
      class of problems above disappears. **This is the highest-leverage unexamined question in the
      repo** - and note it is a question about rarimo's design, not about a stack choice.
- [ ] Do NOT re-open Noir vs Groth16 on the strength of this (2.18dc): the verifier count is a circuit
      -design consequence, and Groth16 would need 79 trusted setups for the same 79 shapes.

### 2.18dc IS NOIR/ULTRAHONK STRICTLY BETTER THAN CIRCOM/GROTH16? NO - and the reason we chose it is one axis (user, 2026-08-04)

*"i just hope we chose the right stack"*. Measured in our own tree, same profile family:

| | runtime size | EIP-170 headroom |
|---|---|---|
| Groth16 `PPerPassport_1_160_3_4_576_200_NAVerifier2` | **1,736 B** | 22,840 |
| Honk `NoirRegisterIdentity_1_160_3_3_576_200_NA` | **18,430 B** | **6,146** |

**GROTH16 WINS ON SIZE BY ~10.6x**, and that is not cosmetic - it is a direct cause of the EIP-170
pressure this repo already carries. Groth16 also has smaller proofs (3 group elements) and a cheaper,
constant-time pairing check, so it wins on calldata and verification gas too.

**WHAT WE BOUGHT INSTEAD, and why it is still the right call HERE:**
1. **NO PER-CIRCUIT TRUSTED SETUP.** Groth16 needs a ceremony PER CIRCUIT. We have **81 live passport
   profiles**. That is 81 ceremonies, or trusting rarimo's - and this whole session has been about
   removing exactly that kind of "someone we must trust". Honk uses a universal SRS: one artifact,
   every circuit. **This axis alone decides it.**
2. **RECURSION.** The N=16 aggregator verifies proofs inside a proof. Groth16 does not do this
   natively; Honk does. Section 2.4's entire design depends on it.
3. **Circuits are maintainable.** Noir is a language; Circom is a constraint DSL. Sections 2.18m and
   the `EC_LEN` work in 2.18cy were only tractable because the circuit reads like code.

**SO THE TRADE IS EXPLICIT: we pay ~10x verifier size and more verification gas to remove 81 trusted
setups and to make recursion possible.** Anyone reopening this should argue against THAT trade, not
against Honk in general - and should note that the Groth16 verifiers we keep for the six orphans are
evidence the two can coexist where it helps.

- [ ] When EIP-170 is finally addressed (deferred by the repo owner until last), remember the cause is
      partly this choice. The fix is splitting verifiers, not revisiting the stack.

### 2.18da THE ORPHANS ARE ENUMERABLE AFTER ALL - EC_LEN is quantised by data-group count (user, 2026-08-04)

*"could we do this in any way synthetically?"* **Yes, and it collapses the problem from a passport
dependency to a handful of builds.**

**WHY EC_LEN IS NOT FREE-VALUED.** eContent is an `LDSSecurityObject`: a header plus one
`DataGroupHash` entry per data group. So `EC_LEN = base + n x (hashlen + DER overhead)` - it is
quantised by HOW MANY DATA GROUPS the document carries. Measured across all 75 published profiles,
the gaps between consecutive `EC_LEN` values are exactly that:

| DG_HASH_ALGO | dominant gaps | = one DataGroupHash entry |
|---|---|---|
| SHA-1 (20B) | 25, 27, 29 | 20 + 5..9 |
| SHA-256 (32B) | 37, 39, 42 | 32 + 5..10 |
| SHA-512 (64B) | 126 | two entries |

**SO THE CANDIDATE SET IS TINY.** `EC_BLOCK_NUMBER` bounds `EC_LEN` to one 64- or 128-byte window,
and only quantised values inside it are physically possible. Intersecting the window with values
actually observed in real profiles:

| orphan | window | candidates |
|---|---|---|
| `1_160_3_4_576_200_NA` | 185-247 | **209 - UNIQUE, fully determined** |
| `1_256_3_6_336_560_1_2744_4_256` | 313-375 | 336, 338, 375 |
| `14_256_3_4_336_64_1_1480_5_296` | 185-247 | 217, 219, 233 |
| `20_160_3_3_736_200_NA` | 121-183 | 126, 153, 155, 180 |
| `20_256_3_5_336_72_NA` | 249-311 | 256, 258, 297, 299, 311 |
| `4_160_3_3_336_216_1_1296_3_256` | 121-183 | 126, 153, 155, 180 |

**20 candidate builds, not 6 x 64 = 384** - and one orphan needs no guess at all. `SA_LEN` narrows the
same way: it is single-valued for `1_160_3` (104), `20_160_3` (92) and `20_256_3` (74).

**AND A WRONG CANDIDATE IS INERT, NOT DANGEROUS** - which is what makes this safe. A verifier built
for the wrong `EC_LEN` simply never verifies a real proof of that profile; it cannot accept anything
it should not. **The CLIENT holds the real document and therefore knows the true `EC_LEN`**, so it
selects the matching verifier. Nothing needs a passport on OUR side.

- [x] **DROPPED on the repo owner's instruction ("no inerts") and one was BACKED OUT (ca43fb1).** A derived verifier displaced a Circom one that covers the whole block window. Superseded: build the 20 candidates, register them
      keyed by profile+EC_LEN, and let the client select. Retires the six orphans without a document.
- [ ] Cheap first check before building: 2.18cy showed `SA_LEN`/`DG1_LEN`/`N` are recoverable from the
      name, so only `EC_LEN` (and `DG15_LEN` on the two AA profiles) is being enumerated.

### 2.18db KECCAK vs POSEIDON IS PRINCIPLED - but self-proved non-membership breaks the split (user, 2026-08-04)

*"why are you inlining poseidon if we did keccak elsewhere?"* Because the two are used where each is
CHEAP, and it is not arbitrary:

| root | hash | who verifies it | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RegistrySourceAnchor` snapshots, `icaoMasterTreeMerkleRoot` | **keccak** | Solidity (`MerkleProof.verify`) | ~30 gas on the EVM |
| `certificatesSmt`, `IdentityRegistry`, notary tree, PP state | **Poseidon** | circuits (`notary_action` proves `notary_root`) | cheap in-circuit; keccak costs ~34% more gates |

Inlining Poseidon targets the third column's EVM-side cost - **32,549 gas per 2-input hash through a
DELEGATECALL**, ~90k inlined for a depth-32 insert instead of over 1M. It does not touch the keccak
roots and does not conflict with them.

**BUT THE NEW DESIGN LANDS EXACTLY ON THE SEAM.** Self-proved non-membership (2.18cu) proves against
the SANCTIONS root **in-circuit** - and that root is keccak, chosen when only Solidity read it. So one
of these must give:
- **circuit pays keccak**: a Merkle path is only ~depth hashes, but keccak is heavy in Noir;
- **anchor publishes a Poseidon root too**: cheap in-circuit, but computing Poseidon over thousands of
  leaves ON-CHAIN is enormous - at 32,549 gas per hash it dwarfs the keccak root it accompanies;
- **switch the sanctions registry to Poseidon**: cheapest in-circuit, but then `TitleLedger`'s
  Solidity-side `MerkleProof.verify` pays Poseidon on the EVM instead.

**Note the third option gets much cheaper if Poseidon is inlined first** - which is another reason to
do that before deciding this, rather than after.

- [ ] Decide the sanctions root's hash by measuring both sides, AFTER inlining Poseidon. Do not pick
      it from the current numbers; inlining moves the very quantity the decision turns on.

### 2.18cz WHAT FOLDS AND WHAT CANNOT - and 7 profiles we are missing (user, 2026-08-04)

*"are you sure there is no other way... fold as many things together as possible for efficiency
without creating privacy leaks"*.

**ON THE SIX: EXHAUSTED, now against every source rather than one.** All 54 releases of
`passport-zk-circuits-noir` enumerated - **82 distinct artifacts, and none of the six**. rarimo's
Circom `test/inputs/{passport,generated}` contain only Readmes: real passport inputs are deliberately
unpublished. So `EC_LEN` genuinely exists nowhere outside a document.

**BUT THE SEARCH FOUND SOMETHING BETTER: WE ARE MISSING 7 PUBLISHED PROFILES.** Our manifest has 75;
rarimo has published 82. Obtainable now, same recovery method as the original 75:
```
14_256_1_4_1752_576_1_1496_3_512   1_256_1_5_2376_336_1_2120_4_512
20_256_3_5_336_248_25_2120_5_1816  20_256_3_6_336_248_NA
21_160_1_2_560_576_NA              25_384_1_3_336_256_NA
26_512_3_2_336_248_1_1384_2_256
```
**Four are `DOCUMENT_TYPE=1` (TD1/ID cards)** - worth noting next to the quarantined `ID_Card_I`.

- [x] DONE, PARTIALLY: 3 built, 3 quarantined as degenerate (dg1 length 0), 1 blocked by a nargo bug. Downloaded artifacts, read generics from the embedded `main.nr`, extended the manifest,
      generate verifiers. Coverage 75 -> 82, and it needs no document and no new RAM.

**ON FOLDING - ONE IS FREE, ONE IS NOT, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE PRIVACY CONSTRAINT.**

**THE FREE ONE, AND IT IS THE BIGGEST NUMBER IN THIS AREA: INLINE POSEIDON.** Every Poseidon call in
`PoseidonSMT`, `StateKeeper`, `IdentityRegistry`, `HolderStateKeeper` and `TitleLedger` pays the
DELEGATECALL price. A depth-32 insert is ~32 hashes: **over 1M gas today, ~90k inlined - a ~91% cut**,
repo-wide, with **zero privacy implication**. It benefits registration, revocation, ASP admission and
the title ledger at once. Nothing about the sanctions design changes it, and it should not wait on it.
Its own precondition stands: vendor properly with a per-arity differential test, never ship the
`sed`'d copies in `contracts/libraries/inline/` - a Poseidon that is fast and subtly wrong silently
forks every commitment in the system.

**WHAT WILL NOT FOLD TO ZERO, and the reason is exactly the leak the user asked me to avoid.** The
sanctions check reuses everything structural the holder already runs - same Poseidon, same SMT
machinery, same verifier - so its MARGINAL cost is far below a separate subsystem. But it cannot
collapse into the existing `commitment -> 0` term, because that term proves *nobody revoked me* and
says nothing about a name. Closing that gap needs the holder's NAME bound to their leaf, and:
- publish a deterministic `hash(name)` in the leaf and **anyone can grind the register and match** -
  the precise disclosure 2.18bm removes from `notaryDataHash`, reintroduced one layer down;
- blind it, and no one can match it against the public list either - including honestly.

**THAT IS WHAT THE OPRF IS FOR (2.18ax/bj/bk), and this is the argument that makes it load-bearing
rather than optional**: a blinded, deterministic-per-subject value is exactly the primitive that lets
a public list be matched without the leaf being grindable. Until it exists, the choice is a leak or an
authority - and both have been rejected here already.

- [x] **WRONG AND ALREADY DONE.** Inlining landed long ago and is worth **12%**, not 91% - see the correction in 2.x and `PoseidonInlineGas.t.sol`. Left struck through because the 91% figure drove a priority call.
- [ ] ~~Treat the OPRF as a dependency of self-proved non-membership.~~ **RE-ORDERED by 2.18er**: the
      OPRF defeats grindability but requires a canonical identifier it does not create, and being a
      two-party protocol it contradicts 2.18cu's "nobody whose action is required". The identifier is
      the blocker; the OPRF comes after one exists.

### 2.18cy THE SIX ORPHANS: EC_LEN IS THE ONLY MISSING GENERIC, AND IT IS DOCUMENT-SPECIFIC (2026-08-04)

Chased the one avenue that could have closed these without a passport - rarimo's CIRCOM circuits,
which those six DO exist as (we hold their Groth16 verifiers). **The tuple name decodes completely**,
which was worth learning: `circuits/identityManagement/registerIdentityBuilder.circom` takes exactly
the tuple in order -

    SIGNATURE_TYPE, DG_HASH_TYPE, DOCUMENT_TYPE, EC_BLOCK_NUMBER,
    EC_SHIFT, DG1_SHIFT, AA_SIGNATURE_ALGO, DG15_SHIFT, DG15_BLOCK_NUMBER, AA_SHIFT

so `1_160_3_4_576_200_NA` is RSA-2048/SHA-1, TD3, 4 EC blocks, shifts 576/200, no Active Auth.

**BUT CIRCOM IS PARAMETERISED IN BLOCKS AND NOIR IN BYTES, AND THAT GAP IS THE WHOLE PROBLEM.**
Measured against all 75 published profiles:

| generic | recoverable from the tuple? |
|---|---|
| `DG1_LEN` | **yes** - 93 for every TD3 profile, 0 of 65 shapes ambiguous |
| `SA_LEN` | **yes** - 0 of 65 shapes ambiguous |
| `N` | **yes** - a function of `SIGNATURE_TYPE` (18 for RSA-2048, 26 for RSA-3072, 6 for ECDSA) |
| `EC_LEN` | **NO** - and it is the one that matters |

`EC_BLOCK_NUMBER` only bounds it: it is `ceil((EC_LEN + 9) / blocksize)`, so block 4 admits any
`EC_LEN` in a 64-byte window. Even at FULL tuple shape, 2 of 65 keys map to two different `EC_LEN`
values (`1_256_3_4_336_232` -> 217 and 233). And **none of the six has an exact-shape match** among
the 75 to copy from.

**SO THE EARLIER CONCLUSION SURVIVES, NOW PROVEN THREE WAYS** rather than asserted: the Circom source
is coarser than Noir needs; tuple shape does not pin `EC_LEN` even within the published set; and no
published profile shares a shape with any of the six. `EC_LEN` is the byte length of a real
document's eContent - it is a property of a PASSPORT, not of a parameter table.

**WHAT THIS BUYS ANYWAY, and it is not nothing:** when a document of one of these profiles does turn
up, **only `EC_LEN` needs measuring**. The other thirteen generics are already derivable from the
name, so each orphan costs one measurement, not a reverse-engineering exercise.

- [ ] Six orphans need one SOD each. NOT RAM-blocked, NOT toolchain-blocked - the swap fix does not
      touch them. Same document dependency as task 6.
- [ ] Until then the Groth16 verifiers for those six MUST stay: they are those profiles' only
      verifier, and `_verifyCircomZKProof` stays reachable for exactly that reason (2.18co).

### 2.18cw REMOVING ALL FOUR, AND EACH REPLACEMENT IS STRICTLY STRONGER (user, 2026-08-03)

*"there must be a way that we can strengthen security while removing the postman entirely"*. There is,
and it is not a trade. **Every authority in this repo exists at a point where a fact is ASSERTED
instead of PROVEN.** Replace each assertion with a proof against source-signed or quorum-signed data
and the authority disappears BECAUSE the guarantee got stronger, not despite it.

| authority | today ONE KEY can | after, an attacker needs |
|---|---|---|
| `REGISTRY_POSTMAN` (anchor) | publish a fabricated register | forge ICAO's CMS signature, or compromise a DON quorum |
| `REGISTRY_POSTMAN` (TitleLedger) | enrol a fake notary; revoke ANY notary | a genuine passport matching a register entry; the register to actually delist them |
| `CONTROLLER` (IdentityRegistry) | revoke anyone - and must DE-ANONYMISE to do it | the published list to name them; nobody reads an envelope |
| backend signer (HolderRegistration) | admit anyone, or refuse anyone with a real passport | a genuine ICAO certificate chain |

**AND MY "SOME CONTROLLER IS UNAVOIDABLE" CLAIM (2.18cu) WAS WRONG - measured today.** I said
`document.not-current` has no source of truth to prove against. It has two, and neither needs an
authority:
1. **EXPIRY IS IN THE DOCUMENT ITSELF.** `query_identity` ALREADY takes
   `expiration_date_lowerbound/upperbound` as public inputs (`main.nr:15-16`, `query.nr:354`). Document
   currency is a property of the signed MRZ, not an external fact - **the circuit exists and its
   verifier was regenerated today.**
2. **ISSUER REVOCATION HAS A SIGNED FEED WE ALREADY HOLD.** The PKD ships CRLs
   (`icaopkd-002-complete-527.ldif` + deltas). CMS-signed like the master list, so anchoring them
   needs no authority either, and the holder proves non-membership the same way as for sanctions.

**SO ALL FOUR FALL, AND THE HARD PART IS ONE CIRCUIT PLUS ONE SIGNATURE CHECK** - the name-binding
circuit (2.18cr) and in-contract DON signature verification (2.18cp). Everything else is already
written.

**THE ONE THAT DWARFS ALL FOUR, AND IT IS NOT A POSTMAN.** Ten `_authorizeUpgrade` sites, every one
owner- or role-gated, including `RegistrySourceAnchor`, `Entrypoint`, `TitleLedger` and `StateKeeper`.
**An owner who can `upgradeToAndCall` can replace every proof check listed above.** Removing four
postmen while that stands is renaming the authority, not removing it - and it would be this session's
own failure mode at the largest possible scale.

**THE REPO ALREADY KNOWS THE ANSWER AND APPLIED IT ELSEWHERE:** *"only PP's fund-custody contracts -
PrivacyPool/State - are deliberately immutable, a trust-minimization choice for the vault logic
specifically"*. The proof-path contracts deserve the same treatment once the proofs are in place.

**ORDER MATTERS, because immutability is irreversible:**
- [ ] 1. Land the proofs first - name-binding circuit, DON signature verification, CRL anchoring,
      expiry bound enforced at withdrawal. Freezing before this locks in the postman forever.
- [ ] 2. Remove the four authorities as each proof lands, smallest blast radius first.
- [ ] 3. THEN freeze the proof-path contracts (immutable, or an owner-renounced timelock). Until this
      step, the honest claim is "fewer authorities", never "trustless".
- [ ] Never claim the postman is gone while step 3 is open - the upgrade key IS the postman, with a
      larger power than any of the four.

### 2.18cv THE POSTMAN INVENTORY - one is gone, four are not (user: "there is no postman anymore", 2026-08-03)

**Not yet.** What was deleted was `_ASP_POSTMAN` (e9837fe), and it gated **nothing** - declared,
admin'd and granted while guarding no function, so removing it changed no behaviour. Measured, these
still gate write paths:

| authority | gates | removed by |
|---|---|---|
| `REGISTRY_POSTMAN` | `RegistrySourceAnchor.onReport` - now the ONLY entrypoint, so the role is MORE load-bearing than before, not less | verify DON signatures in-contract (2.18cp) |
| `REGISTRY_POSTMAN` (borrowed) | `TitleLedger.registerNotary:304`, `revokeNotary:334` | 2.18bo's three levers; needs the role split (2.18cn) first |
| `CONTROLLER` | `IdentityRegistry.revoke:319` | 2.18cu, for the sanctions predicate ONLY |
| backend signer | every `HolderRegistration` entry point but one | `Registration2.registerViaNoir`, already in-repo and unused (2.18cs) |

**SO: ONE DECORATIVE POSTMAN DELETED, FOUR REAL AUTHORITIES STANDING.** Saying otherwise would be the
exact error this session kept finding - a pin nothing checks, a role that gates nothing, an "ENFORCED"
heading over a liveness test. **The ASP postman was the easy one because it was never real.**

- [ ] Track these four to zero. None is blocked on a decision: three share the same circuit (2.18cu)
      or the same role split (2.18cn), and the fourth is a swap to code already written.

### 2.18cu SELF-PROVED NON-MEMBERSHIP - reinstating 2.18ct's retraction, which was wrong twice (user, 2026-08-03)

*"remember why you proposed it, we need to solve the problem with a better approach that makes no
compromises"*. Re-examined, and **both grounds I retracted on are wrong.**

**GROUND (b) WAS BACKWARDS - failure direction follows the list's POLARITY, not the presence of a gate.**
- **allowlist**: you must be IN it. Nobody adds you -> you can never prove -> censored. Fails CLOSED.
- **blacklist non-membership**: you must NOT be in it. Nobody is added -> **everyone proves trivially**.
  Fails **OPEN**.

Inaction SHRINKS a blacklist, so a stalled feed lets more people through, not fewer. The censorship
lever becomes an affirmative, visible, rule-bound act of ADDING someone - precisely what 2.13b asks
for. I conflated *"a gate that must succeed"* with *"an allowlist"*.

**GROUND (a) WAS WRONG TOO - the two proofs are not the same claim.**

| | proves | requires |
|---|---|---|
| merged tree `commitment -> 0` | *nobody has revoked me* | an actor running a matcher, AND the controller opening envelopes to de-anonymise |
| sanctions non-membership | *I am not on the source list* | nothing - the holder proves it themselves |

The merged tree only knows what the controller PUT in it. So feed-into-`revoke` - the design I called
elegant - **reinstates a trusted actor with de-anonymisation power**. I traded the no-authority
property away to save a circuit term and did not notice, because "fewer moving parts" measured the
wrong axis.

**THE UNCOMPROMISED DESIGN, whose every piece is already in this repo:** the holder proves
non-membership of the sanctions list **at withdrawal, in-circuit, against the anchored root**. No
controller reads anyone. No matcher runs over the population. **Nobody can be silent, because there is
nobody whose action is required.**

**AND ITS ONE REAL OBJECTION IS ALREADY SOLVED HERE.** A stale root under-approximates the blacklist,
so a newly-listed person could prove against an old root forever - verbatim `IdentityRegistry` trap 1,
answered by `isValidRoot`: `MAX_ROOT_AGE` enforced, **"with the latest root always valid so inaction
stays harmless"**. Bounded staleness AND fail-open, in shipped code. Reuse it; do not redesign it.

**WHAT KEEPS A CONTROLLER, said plainly rather than implied away:** predicates with no external
register behind them - `document.not-current` and its kind. There is no source of truth to prove
against, so an authority is unavoidable there. The sanctions predicate is the one that can be made
authority-free, and claiming more would overstate it.

**COST, RESTATED HONESTLY - "marginal cost is zero" dies with the feed design.** The withdrawal circuit
gains a bracketing term: two inclusion proofs plus two ordering comparisons. So the ~8-opcode estimate
does need the recheck I first flagged and then wrongly withdrew. **That is the price of not
compromising, and it is the right trade.**

- [ ] Withdrawal-time non-membership against the anchored sanctions root, root validity by
      `isValidRoot`'s existing rule. Supersedes 2.18cq's admission gate AND 2.18ct's feed.
- [ ] Recheck the ~8-opcode estimate against the bracketing term (third revision of this number; the
      first two were artifacts of designs since dropped).

### 2.18ct FEWER MOVING PARTS - SUPERSEDED BY 2.18cu, both its grounds were wrong (user, 2026-08-03)

**READ 2.18cu FIRST.** This section retracted 2.18cq's bracketing design on two grounds, and both
collapsed under re-examination: the fail-closed argument confused gate-direction with list-polarity,
and the redundancy argument compared two proofs that establish different claims under different trust.
Kept for the reasoning trail; **its conclusion is not current.**

*"if you reduce moving parts or make existing parts more elegant take that into consideration, look at
it from all sides"*. Done, and the biggest saving is deleting a design I proposed two sections ago.

**WHAT I PROPOSED (2.18cq):** admission by BRACKETING against the anchored sanctions root - prove
`leaf[i] < x < leaf[i+1]`, hence "not on the list". It leaned on `_computeRoot`'s strictly-ascending
invariant and I called it lean because it needed no new tree.

**WHY IT IS THE WRONG SHAPE, ON TWO INDEPENDENT GROUNDS.**

**(a) THE NON-MEMBERSHIP PROOF IS ALREADY BUILT AND ALREADY PAID FOR.** 2.13e's merge encodes status in
the leaf VALUE, so **an inclusion proof of `commitment -> 0` IS a proof of non-membership of the
blacklist.** That is exactly why the merge cut 43,772 -> 24,812 opcodes. The withdrawal circuit ALREADY
carries this term. Bracketing would be a **second** non-membership mechanism, in a second tree, with a
second proof - to establish what the existing term establishes. Two mechanisms for one property is the
definition of a moving part that should not exist.

**(b) IT REINTRODUCES THE FAILURE MODE 2.13b EXISTS TO REMOVE.** A bracketing check at ADMISSION is an
allowlist gate: it must SUCCEED before you may enter. If the anchor is stale, unreachable, or the feed
stalls, it **fails closed** - which is 2.13b's exact objection, *"an allowlist fails closed by
omission, so a postman censors you without ever acting"*. The merged tree fails **open**: if nothing
revokes you, you withdraw. I re-derived the allowlist while believing I was implementing the blacklist.

**THE ELEGANT FORM, WHICH IS ALSO THE SMALLEST:**

    sanctions snapshot ──► revoke(commitment, predicate) ──► existing merged tree
                                                             ▲
                                withdrawal already proves ────┘  commitment -> 0

**Nothing is added to the withdrawal path at all.** No admission function, no bracketing, no second
tree, no dependency on strictly-ascending leaves for screening (that invariant keeps its own job -
enforcing that a snapshot is canonical and duplicate-free). Screening becomes a FEED into a mechanism
that is already built, already measured, and already enforced at the only point that matters.

**AND IT CORRECTS 2.18cs's LAST BULLET.** I said the ~8-opcode estimate was a different cost class
because bracketing costs two inclusion proofs plus two comparisons. That objection dies with the
bracketing design: with the feed-into-revocation shape the withdrawal term **already exists**, so the
marginal circuit cost is **zero** and ~8 opcodes was the right order all along.

**WHAT STILL DOES NOT CHANGE:** the direction that needs a circuit is now only ONE - prove a registered
document's name matches a sanctions leaf, INCLUSION only (2.18cr's easier column). Revocation was
always the tractable direction; removing admission means it is the only one.

**TWO SMALLER REDUCTIONS, from the same pass:**
- [x] **DONE (726116a).** `publishSnapshot` deleted; `onReport` is the only entrypoint. It duplicated it minus the workflow check, and was the one
      path no pin constrains (2.18ck). Deleting removes a moving part AND closes the bypass - the
      same act, which is what makes it worth doing rather than gating it harder.
- [ ] **`ROOT_ACTIVATION_DELAY` is still live** in `latestActiveRoot`, although 2.18br concluded it
      should be DELETED because verified provenance makes bad data impossible rather than merely
      detectable. Either act on that conclusion or record why it was reversed; a delay nobody can
      justify is the clamp standing rule 3 names.

- [x] DONE - and then 2.18cu retracted the retraction. Screening is NOT a feed into `revoke`, not a
      new gate.

### 2.18cs EVIDENCE FOR #41, FROM THE SHIPPED CODE - two of its open questions are already answered (2026-08-03)

Read after #41 was booked, so it is additive. Everything here is from `IdentityRegistry.sol`, not from
the design sections.

**1. 2.13e's "the blacklist and the revocation registry are the same object" IS ALREADY BUILT.** Not a
decision waiting to be taken - the header says *"WHY ONE TREE AND NOT TWO"*: status is encoded in the
leaf VALUE (`0` = clean, non-zero = predicate), so a single inclusion proof of `commitment -> 0` does
both jobs. **Measured: 43,772 -> 24,812 ACIR opcodes, a 43% cut**, and it removes `sk_identity` from
the withdrawal entirely. **What is missing is the FEED, not the structure** - nothing populates that
tree from sanctions data. Whoever opens #41 should not re-derive the merge.

**2. THE TRAP AT LINE 2257 IS ALREADY DOCUMENTED IN THE CONTRACT, AND STILL OPEN.** Trap 6 states it
outright: *"anyone revoked could escrow a fresh secret against the same passport and come back clean"*.
The guard that exists - `commitment` is a function of `sk_identity`, so `registered[commitment]` stops
a literal repeat - does not stop a NEW secret over the SAME document. So the leaf must bind to
something unregenerable: a **document nullifier**, not a key the user picks. That is the concrete form
of "the leaf has to bind to something unregenerable".

**3. THE LABEL TERM'S SILENCE PROBLEM IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL - THE LEVER IS LIVE TODAY, UPSTREAM.**
`IdentityRegistry.register`'s own comment scopes its permissionlessness honestly: *"It is true of THIS
function and false of the system as it currently stands."* Registering requires the document to already
sit in `registrationSmt`, and the only writer - `HolderRegistration` - **requires a backend signer's
signature on every entry point**. *"A key we hold can be ordered to withhold, and the person is
blocked."* So censorship-by-inaction already exists one layer above the pool, independent of whether
the predicate set is conjunctive.

**AND THE ANSWER IS ALREADY IN THE REPO, UNUSED:** `Registration2.registerViaNoir` takes no signature
and is gated only by a proof against a certificates root. **That is the precedent for how a label is
obtained without an authority** - by proof, so there is nobody to be silent. It collapses the three
options #41 lists to one: a permissionless label and evidence-bound labelling are the same thing, and
a default-admit-after-timeout rule is unsound - it admits precisely the people the list names whenever
the feed stalls.

**4. THE ~8-OPCODE ESTIMATE NEEDS MORE THAN RECHECKING FOR CONJUNCTION.** Non-membership by bracketing
is **two inclusion proofs plus two ordering comparisons**, not one inclusion proof - a different cost
class from the merged-tree term it is being added to.

- [ ] For #41: bind the leaf to a document nullifier (trap 6), not to `sk_identity`.
- [ ] For #41: the label term's answer to silence is `registerViaNoir`'s shape. Also fix the live
      upstream lever - `HolderRegistration`'s backend signature - or the conjunction inherits it.

### 2.18cr EVIDENCE-BOUND REVOCATION IS NOT CONTRACT-ONLY - I said it was, and the envelope says otherwise (2026-08-03)

I offered `IdentityRegistry.revoke` as *"contract-only, buildable next"* - the one that removes a real
authority rather than a decorative one. **Checked the mechanism before building around it, and it does
not hold.**

**WHY. THE BINDING IS INSIDE A SEALED ENVELOPE, BY DESIGN.** `register` requires the escrow proof's
envelope to be sealed to `CONTROLLER_KEY_X/Y`, and rejects any other key with `WrongControllerKey` -
trap 5's stated reason being that otherwise the registration is *"unreadable by the only party that
could ever act on it - a registration nobody can revoke"*. So on-chain there is **no plaintext link
from a commitment to a real-world identity**, and that is not an oversight: it is the privacy property
the whole design exists to provide. `revoke` is gated on `CONTROLLER` because **only the controller
can see who is who.**

**SO A CONTRACT CANNOT CHECK A SANCTIONS ROOT AGAINST A COMMITMENT.** Nothing on-chain can tell whether
snapshot leaf L and commitment C describe the same person. A version that merely required the caller
to CITE an anchored `(registryId, index)` would verify that the snapshot exists while proving nothing
about whether it justifies this revocation - a check that constrains the wrong half, which is the
false-safety shape standing rule 3 exists to refuse. **Not built, deliberately.**

**WHAT IT ACTUALLY NEEDS - and the direction is the easier one, which is worth knowing:**
| | proves | needs |
|---|---|---|
| **revocation** | the subject **IS** on the list | INCLUSION - a plain Merkle proof, no ordering required |
| **admission** (2.18cq) | the subject is **NOT** on the list | NON-inclusion by bracketing - needs the strictly-ascending leaves |

Both need the SAME missing piece: a circuit binding the registered document's name to a sanctions leaf.
It is the same name-binding circuit as 2.18bo step 2 for notaries - **one circuit unblocks the notary
path, pool admission, and evidence-bound revocation.** That is the highest-leverage unbuilt item in
this area, and it is why building any of the three in isolation would be wasted work.

- [ ] Name-binding circuit: prove `hash(document name fields) == leaf` for a leaf in an anchored
      registry root, reusing `query_identity`'s selective MRZ disclosure. Unblocks three paths.
- [ ] THEN evidence-bound `revoke`: inclusion proof replaces `CONTROLLER`'s discretion for the
      sanctions predicate specifically. Other predicates (document-not-current) have no external
      register behind them and keep a controller - say so rather than implying the role disappears.

### 2.18cq THE BLACKLIST IS NOT INTEGRATED WITH THE ASP AT ALL - and the lean way in already exists (user, 2026-08-03)

*"are you sure that we integrated with the original PP label ASP in the most lean and elegant possible
way these extended capabilities (blacklist, etc)"* **No - because there is no integration to judge.**
Measured, not recalled:

- **`blacklist` appears in this repo ONLY IN COMMENTS.** `IdentityRegistry.sol:60`,
  `HolderStateKeeper.sol:82/112/162` describe what blacklisting would act on. Audited by structure
  rather than by name: **there is no blacklist function, tree or root anywhere.**
- **`RegistrySourceAnchor` has exactly two referencing files: `TitleLedger` and itself.** The pool
  never reads it. So the entire sanctions pipeline - four registers, the decoder, consensus, the
  anchor, the workflow pin - **terminates at the anchor and is consumed only by the notary/title
  path.** None of it reaches a deposit or a withdrawal.
- **ASP admission is still a trusted signature.** `_admitIdentity` takes an `_ASP_POSTMAN` EIP-712
  signature over `(holderRoot, deadline)`. Insert-only, replay-protected - well built - but the
  criterion for admission is *"the postman decided so"*, with nothing linking it to any register.

**SO THE SANCTIONS WORK AND THE POOL ARE TWO SYSTEMS THAT HAVE NEVER MET.** That is the real state,
and it is worth more than an opinion about elegance.

**AND THE LEAN INTEGRATION NEEDS NO NEW MACHINERY - the enabling property is already enforced.**
`_computeRoot` reverts `LeavesNotStrictlySorted` unless `leaves_[i] > leaves_[i-1]`, so every anchored
snapshot is a **strictly ascending** leaf set. That is exactly what makes **NON-membership provable**:
show two adjacent leaves bracketing the subject (`leaf[i] < x < leaf[i+1]`) with their inclusion
proofs, and absence is proven against a plain keccak Merkle root. No second tree, no separate
blacklist structure, no exclusion registry.

**WHICH ALSO REMOVES ANOTHER POSTMAN, and that is why it is the right shape rather than merely a
cheaper one.** If admission requires a bracketing proof against the CRE-anchored sanctions root
instead of an `_ASP_POSTMAN` signature, the criterion stops being *"someone decided"* and becomes
*"the published list does not contain this subject"*. Same move as 2.18cp: replace an authority with a
check anyone can perform.

**THE HONEST CAVEAT, so this is not oversold:** 2.18cb's axis 4 applies here too. Bracketing proves
absence from THE SNAPSHOT. Whether absence from the snapshot means "not sanctioned" depends on the
register expressing exclusion by absence rather than by a status field - and for the sanctions lists
that is the natural reading, unlike the Ukrainian notary register where 2.18cf measured the opposite.
Each source needs that answered explicitly, in the `SourceSpec` table where the other per-source
semantics already live.

- [x] ~~Wire the pool to the anchor: admission by bracketing proof against the sanctions root~~
      **RETRACTED by 2.18ct.** The bracketing gate is an allowlist that fails closed, and the merged
      tree's `commitment -> 0` inclusion proof already IS the non-membership proof. Screening is a
      FEED into `revoke`, adding nothing to the withdrawal path.
- [ ] Record per-source whether exclusion is by ABSENCE or by a status field, in `SourceSpec`
      alongside `Authenticity`. Without it a bracketing proof means different things per register.

### 2.18cp "WHY CAN'T IT BE REMOVED?" - it can; the claim conflated trust with authority (user, 2026-08-03)

I cited `sources.go:149` - *"the snapshot rests on DON honesty, and the postman CANNOT be removed for
this source"* - as settled. **The conclusion does not follow from its own premise, and the question
exposed it.** Two different things were collapsed into one word:

| | unsigned source (OFAC/UK/UN/Ukraine) | signed source (ICAO) |
|---|---|---|
| **whom you trust about the CONTENT** | the DON - irreducible, nothing else vouches for bytes the publisher never signed | nobody: the authority signed it |
| **who may SUBMIT** | **removable** | **removable** |

**"Rests on DON honesty" constrains the first column only.** The postman is not the DON - it is
whoever holds the key that sends the transaction. Verify the DON's report signature **in the contract**
and that key stops being trusted: anyone may relay, and a forged report fails the check. It is exactly
the move ICAO's CMS signature makes for a signed source, with the DON's quorum key in place of the
authority's. Chainlink's own Forwarder already does this verification - which is why "grant the role to
the Forwarder" reduces the postman to a relay. Doing it in-contract removes the role outright.

**WHAT REMOVAL ACTUALLY REQUIRES, and this is the part the old claim hid by being too pessimistic:**
1. the DON's on-chain signer set / config digest, to check a quorum signature;
2. **replay protection** - a permissionless relay can re-submit an OLD valid report and regress
   `latestRoot`, which a trusted postman implicitly prevented by not doing it. The metadata header
   already carries what this needs: **timestamp at offset 33, execution ID at offset 1** (2.18ck).

**SO THE HONEST STATEMENT IS THE NARROW ONE:** for an unsigned source, **DON TRUST cannot be removed**;
the postman can. For a signed source, both can. `sources.go` corrected in place - the field records
what the export is, and no longer draws a conclusion about authority from it.

- [ ] Verify DON report signatures in `RegistrySourceAnchor` and drop `onlyRole` from the report path,
      with replay protection keyed on the header's timestamp/execution ID. This supersedes "grant the
      role to the Forwarder" (2.18cl/2.18cm) as the STRONGER option, and it is the only one that
      removes the key rather than relocating it.

### 2.18cn ONE ROLE, THREE POWERS - "why are you conflating the postman and the forwarder?" (user, 2026-08-03)

**I WAS CONFLATING THEM, AND THE CODE SAYS WHY THAT IS WORSE THAN SLOPPY WORDING.** A forwarder is not
a role, it is a candidate HOLDER of one - so "grant `REGISTRY_POSTMAN` to the Forwarder" (2.18cl,
2.18cm) is only safe if the role has exactly one job. Enumerated, it has **three, across two
contracts**:

| holder must be | power | site |
|---|---|---|
| a machine (DON relay) | publish register snapshots | `RegistrySourceAnchor.publishSnapshot` / `onReport` |
| a human/operator | enrol a notary into the SMT | `TitleLedger.registerNotary:304` |
| a human/operator | **revoke a notary** | `TitleLedger.revokeNotary:334` |

**SO THE "FIX" I PROPOSED WOULD HAND CHAINLINK'S FORWARDER THE POWER TO REVOKE EVERY NOTARY** - and
`revokeNotary`'s own comment calls that ***"THE ENTIRE FAULT MECHANISM"*** (2.18am). Conversely, any
operator key kept for notary administration can publish fabricated register snapshots, because **it is
the same role**. That is not a deployment act. It is a role-splitting problem, and 2.18cl's checkbox
was wrong to call it operational.

**WHY THE POSTMAN EXISTED AT ALL - AND I HAD THE DIRECTION BACKWARDS (user, 2026-08-03).** I wrote that
its "original job is the notary path". **Wrong, and the inversion matters.** `REGISTRY_POSTMAN` is
`RegistrySourceAnchor`'s OWN role for submitting CRE snapshots - **the DON's write path**, which is
also why 2.18bo is titled *where the postman came from*. `TitleLedger` **borrowed** it for notary
binding, deliberately: *"the SAME trust boundary the notary registry itself already rests on, not a
separate, independently-scrutinized admin key"*. The intent - one trust assumption instead of two -
was right. What it quietly did was hand **a snapshot-submission role the power to decide who is a
notary**. Different powers wearing one hat.

Underneath both: a register entry is **public data with no key**, so someone must assert *"this
commitment is that person"*. That is the irreducible reason a postman exists anywhere here.

**AND THE TWO POSTMEN MUST NOT BE CONFUSED - line 7132 is not about this one.** *"THE POSTMAN CANNOT
BE REMOVED - I was wrong to say so"* refers to the **sanctions/CRE** postman.
`sanctions_lists/sources.go:149` states the condition exactly: where the publisher signs nothing, the
only authenticity is a TLS session the DON node *"cannot prove to anyone afterwards - so the snapshot
rests on DON honesty, and the postman CANNOT be removed for this source"*. That is the role doing its
ORIGINAL job. What 2.18bo removes is `TitleLedger`'s **borrowed** use of it - a different question with
a different answer, and reading one as the other has already produced one wrong conclusion.

**HOW 2.18bo REMOVES THE BORROWED USE: split the three levers.**
1. **Arbitrary revocation** - `revokeNotary` today requires **no proof of fault**. Make it require
   evidence: a proof that the register no longer lists that entry, checked against the CRE-anchored
   root the contract already trusts. No new party, pure contract work, cheapest of the three.
2. **Impersonation** - removable with circuits **already built**. `query_identity` proves selective
   MRZ disclosure, so a notary proves in zero knowledge that they hold a current registered document,
   that its name matches register entry E's `fullName`, and that E is in the active-notary root.
   Nobody asserts anything; the attacker now needs a genuine passport matching the target's name
   rather than an admin key.
3. **Refusal** - dissolves once (2) lands: self-service enrolment has nobody to decline.

**THE HONEST WEAKNESS, stated rather than implied:** names are not unique, and region narrows without
closing it. The comparison is against *"one role key can impersonate any notary in the country"*, not
against perfection.

- [x] **DONE.** `NOTARY_REGISTRAR` now gates the TitleLedger pair, with two tests proving separation. Snapshot publication still needs quid's write-once
      address (2.18cm); notary enrolment/revocation keeps a human-held role. Supersedes 2.18cl's
      "grant it to the Forwarder and nothing else", which as written is a privilege escalation.

### 2.18co THE 35/6/ADDRESS CLAIM RE-MEASURED - and today's Docker work did not touch it (2026-08-03)

Re-derived rather than re-quoted, because *"6 profiles lack a Noir twin"* had been carried from task
#10 without deriving it.

| clause | verdict |
|---|---|
| 35 Groth16-era per-passport verifiers present | **still true** - `verifiers2/per-passport` has exactly 35 |
| 6 profiles lack a Noir twin | **still true, now DERIVED** - set-diff of the parameter tuples |
| nothing wires verifiers by address | **false** - `AQueryProofExecutor._setVerifier(address)`; corrected in the README today |

**THE TUPLE DIFF, which is the part that was never actually computed.** Normalising both directories to
their 14-parameter tuple (`PPerPassport_<tuple>Verifier2.sol` vs `NoirRegisterIdentity_<tuple>.sol`)
gives 35 Groth16 and 76 Noir, overlapping in **29**. The six with no Noir twin:
```
1_160_3_4_576_200_NA          20_160_3_3_736_200_NA
1_256_3_6_336_560_1_2744_4_256   20_256_3_5_336_72_NA
14_256_3_4_336_64_1_1480_5_296   4_160_3_3_336_216_1_1296_3_256
```

**AND THEY ARE DISJOINT FROM THE THREE RAM-BLOCKED ONES**, which is the question that prompted this.
`25_384_...`, `27_512_...` and `28_384_...` do not appear in the Groth16 set at all; they have Noir
`.sol` files that are stale beta.1 UltraPlonk. **So today's Docker regeneration has no bearing on any
of the three clauses** - it replaced stale verifiers for profiles that ALREADY had twins. Nothing was
deleted, and no new twin was created. The 35 remain unresolved for the reason 2.18-era work
established: binding is by ADDRESS at deploy time, so a symbol grep scores a live verifier and an
unwired one identically.

**METHODOLOGY, worth keeping:** the count needs `ls`, not `find` filtered on `*erifier*` - several of
the 35 do not carry "verifier" in their filename, and that filter returned 32.

- [ ] Decide the six twinless profiles: generate Noir verifiers or retire the profiles. Not
      RAM-blocked - unlike the three above, so this is doable on this machine.

### 2.18cm THE FORWARDER PATTERN, TAKEN FROM `quid` AS REFERENCE ONLY (user, 2026-08-03)

*"the forwarder wiring should be part of the deployment sequence. check out github.com/quidmints/quid"*,
then: ***"the quid repo is not something we are actively working on at all, nor should we, it's just
for reference."*** **SO NOTHING BELOW IS A TASK IN THAT REPO** - it is prior art and a worked example
of the failure we are trying not to repeat. Do not open work there on the strength of this section.
Read at `../quid` (working tree, and another thread had `evm/scripts/DeployL1.s.sol` modified, so it
is a snapshot). Three observations, and the second one validates the instruction.

**1. ITS ACCESS PATTERN IS STRICTLY BETTER THAN OURS, AND IT ANSWERS 2.18cl DIRECTLY.** `UMA.sol` does
not use a grantable role. It uses a single address plus a **write-once** setter:

    modifier onlyForwarder() { if (msg.sender != FORWARDER) revert NotForwarder(); _; }
    function setForwarder(address _f) external onlyOwner {
        require(FORWARDER == address(0), "already set"); ...

That is the shape 2.18cl argued toward. An `AccessControl` role can be **granted to an EOA at any
later time** - which is exactly how `REGISTRY_POSTMAN` becomes a human key again after we "fix" it by
granting it to the Forwarder. A write-once address cannot: there is no second grant, no role admin,
and no path back to a key. **The fix for our postman is structural, not operational.**

**2. AND `setForwarder` IS NEVER CALLED - ANYWHERE.** Measured: zero call sites outside its own
definition, in scripts, tests or source. So after any deployment `FORWARDER == address(0)`, and since
`msg.sender` can never be the zero address, **`onReport` reverts for every possible caller**. The CRE
forensic watchdog - evidence storage and auto-dispute - is **inert in production**. Fail-CLOSED, so
nothing is at risk; the feature simply does not exist while appearing to. **Zero tests touch the
forwarder path**, which is how it survived.

**3. THE STUB IS BAIT, AND WIRING IT NAIVELY WOULD BE WORSE THAN LEAVING IT.**
`address constant FORWARDER = address(0xF0F0); // stub` sits in `DeployL1.s.sol:45` and
`DeployBase.s.sol:65` and is referenced **zero times** - dead code by rule 1. But the obvious "fix" of
passing it to `setForwarder` in the deploy sequence would be a **permanent brick**: the setter is
write-once, so a stub address can never be corrected. The wiring step needs a REAL address or none.

**WHAT THIS MEANS HERE.** `backend/contracts` has **no deployment scripts at all** - no forge script,
no hardhat, nothing. So 2.18cl's "grant REGISTRY_POSTMAN to the Forwarder and nothing else" has
nowhere to live, and the same silent-inertness failure is available to us the moment we deploy.

- [ ] **Replace `REGISTRY_POSTMAN` with quid's write-once forwarder address** in
      `RegistrySourceAnchor`. This is the real answer to 2.18cl: it removes the human key by
      CONSTRUCTION rather than by remembering not to grant the role. Keep a role only if a
      pre-Forwarder bootstrap is genuinely needed - and if so, see 2.18cl's last item.
- [ ] **Write ibiza's deployment sequence**, with forwarder wiring as an explicit step that FAILS
      LOUDLY when the address is unknown, rather than a constant nobody passes. The lesson from quid
      is that "set it later" and "never set" are indistinguishable without a check.
One more observation, recorded because it tells us where OUR gap generalises and **not** because it is
work: `UMA.onReport` discards `metadata` exactly as ours did, with no pin at all to check it against.
2.18ck was not a one-off mistake in one contract - it is what the `IReceiver` signature invites, since
the interface hands you a field you must actively decide to use.

### 2.18cj THE ENCLAVE 2.18bx WANTED ALREADY EXISTS, IN OUR OWN STACK (user, 2026-08-03)

*"we cant ask anybody to sign anything unless it's operated by us"* and *"if anything helps that is
where the SPV rust is running"*. Both land, and together they settle the unsigned-source problem.

**ASKING THE AUTHORITIES TO SIGN IS OFF THE TABLE.** Measured, all four are unsigned: SDN.XML,
UK_ConList.xml and UN_consolidated.xml contain ZERO signature elements, and 2.18ce already found the
Ukrainian export carries no `.p7s`, `.sig` or КЕП marker in 2.7 MB. Only ICAO signs (CMS SignedData).
So for the other four the choice is DON-majority trust or an attestor **we run**.

**AND THE ATTESTOR EXISTS.** `../SPV/quid-ln/quid-cvm` is a confidential-VM backend on **AMD SEV-SNP**
(vendor `sev` crate, not hand-rolled), and it already exposes exactly the primitive this needs:
- `get_report(None, Some(report_data), None)` - a hardware-signed attestation binding ARBITRARY data
- **`attest_identity(tls_pk: &[u8; 32], evm_addr: &[u8; 20])`** - binds a TLS public key AND an EVM
  address into that report

**WHY THIS BEATS BOTH ALTERNATIVES.** A capability that verifies TLS in-sandbox cannot produce
transferable evidence - TLS record keys are SYMMETRIC, so a node can forge a transcript of a session
it genuinely had, which is the whole reason TLSNotary/zkTLS need MPC. An enclave sidesteps that
entirely: the report is signed by AMD's key over a measurement of the CODE, so "this fetch was
performed by this program" is checkable by anyone, with no MPC and no new Chainlink capability.

**THE SHAPE, and it is cheap on L1:** attest once to bind an EVM address to the code measurement;
pin the MEASUREMENT on-chain; thereafter the anchor accepts updates signed by that address. Routine
refreshes cost one signature, not a proof. `attest_identity` is already written for exactly this
binding.

**AND THE ARCHITECTURE ALLOWS IT WITHOUT COUPLING.** sec. 7: *"Sharing OPERATORS is free (the batcher
and any watcher can run on the same fleet); sharing a REPO breaks the invariant."* An attestor on the
SPV fleet is operators, not repos - SPV still contains zero references to PP.

**WHAT IT DOES NOT FIX, stated so nobody overclaims:** it makes the FETCH honest, not the DATA
authentic. A compromised OFAC web server still poisons the result, because nothing upstream is
signed. It removes the postman AND the DON majority from the trust set, and replaces them with the
code measurement plus AMD's root - which is a real assumption (side channels, and we operate the
host). For ICAO none of this is needed; the signature is strictly better.

### 2.18ci ICAO IS THE SOURCE-SIGNED REGISTER 2.18bv NEEDED - the postman is removable HERE (2026-08-03)

**2.18bv concluded that SOURCE-SIGNED DATA removes the trusted publisher completely** - the workflow
fetches by any means and verifies the authority's signature INSIDE THE SANDBOX against a key pinned
in the contract, so *"a fabricated entry fails signature verification, so it cannot be published at
all"*. No attestor, no upstream SDK change, no self-observed TLS (which 2.18bu proved unreachable).

**THAT DESIGN HAS BEEN BLOCKED ON A MISSING INGREDIENT, and it is no longer missing.** 2.18bw's third
check was whether either register we had actually signs its data, and neither was confirmed. **The
ICAO Master List does.** Verified 2026-08-03:
- CMS SignedData, `sha256WithRSAEncryption`, digest sha256 - `openssl cms -verify` succeeds
- the Master List Signer certificate is issued by
  **`C=UN, O=United Nations, OU=Certification Authorities, CN=United Nations CSCA`**
- and that UN CSCA is ITSELF in the list: **4 certificates, 3 distinct RSA-3072 keys**
  (`0156`, `0367`, and `0368`/`0389` which share a key - a rollover pair)

**SO CSCA ADMISSION NEEDS NO AUTHORITY AT ALL.** Not a postman, not a TSS committee, not an owner
key. The workflow verifies ICAO's signature against the pinned UN CSCA key and consensus runs over an
ALREADY-VERIFIED result, which is exactly 2.18bv's shape. Pin the CSCA rather than the signer so
signer rotation does not require a contract change; ICAO reissues quarterly.

**TWO CORRECTIONS TO WHAT I SAID EARLIER IN THIS SESSION**, both recorded so the reasoning is not
re-run:
1. *"No CRE is needed because the list is signed"* - **wrong framing**. The CRE is still the right
   home; it is simply not the source of authenticity. Consensus stops being what makes the data
   trustworthy and becomes what makes the WORKFLOW's execution agreed - which is 2.18bt's pinning.
2. *"Reuse the ASP_POSTMAN role for CSCA admission"* - **unnecessary for this source.** That proposal
   was right about `changeICAOMasterTreeRoot(bytes32)` being the `updateRoot` anti-pattern PP
   deliberately deleted (an authority publishing a whole off-chain root, able to omit a country
   silently), and right that our fork has no TSS to hold it. But reusing the postman would import an
   authority this data does not need. **Insert-only admission remains the right shape; the signature,
   not a role, is what authorises it.**

**✅ THE CHAIN IS VERIFIED (2026-08-03), and it carries a trap worth knowing before anyone
implements this.** The CMS embeds TWO certificates: the Master List Signer, and the UN CSCA that
issued it. Checked by signature, not by name:

    UN CSCA, RSA-3072, e=65537, SELF-SIGNED (a root)
    sha256(modulus) = 19d41f41feead44d9f2828a9811b2842e4ed31113b0aa80e5897848e1db2a1f4
    -> it signs the Master List Signer's TBS under SHA-256: VERIFIED
    -> and its key IS in the master list, as certificate 0368 (0389 is its rollover twin)

**THE TRAP: `signerCert.issuer != cscaCert.subject` AS BYTES.** The two DNs are encoded differently,
so **an implementation that chains by DN equality REJECTS the real ICAO master list**, while one that
chains by verifying the signature accepts it. This is exactly the non-conformance ICAO warns about in
its own terms, and it is a silent failure - the chain looks broken when it is not. **Chain by
signature; use the DN only as a hint.** It also settles the pinning question in favour of the KEY
rather than the certificate or the name: 0368 and 0389 share a key, so pinning the key covers both
and survives the rollover.

**✅ ICAO'S SIGNATURE IS NOW ENFORCED ON-CHAIN (`test/certificate/IcaoMasterListSignature.t.sol`,
4 tests).** The obstacle looked like size - 876 KB cannot be hashed in calldata or in-circuit - but
CMS does not sign the content directly. It signs `signedAttributes`, a **104-BYTE** structure
CONTAINING `messageDigest = SHA-256(eContent)`. So ONE RSA-2048 verification over 104 bytes yields an
ICAO-authenticated digest of the entire list for ordinary gas (~233k). Verified on-chain by our own
`CRSASigner`; tampering the attributes or substituting the key both fail; and a fourth test pins the
link that makes 104 bytes worth 876 KB - the authenticated attributes really do carry the whole
list's digest.
**So the trusted publisher is gone for the authenticity half: a fabricated master list cannot be
anchored by anyone**, postman, committee or owner.

**✅ AND NO CHALLENGE WINDOW IS NEEDED - I over-engineered this, corrected 2026-08-03 (user).**
I argued the root stays merely "auditable" until `digest -> root` is enforced on-chain, and proposed
either 876 KB of L1 calldata or an optimistic dispute. **Both are unnecessary, because the existing
CRE report path already carries a verified result.** sec. 2.18bv said it in one clause and I did not
follow it: *"consensus still runs over an ALREADY-VERIFIED result."*
- `backend/cre/icao_master_list` verifies ICAO's signature **inside the sandbox**, per node
- every DON node does so independently and must agree byte-for-byte before a report exists
- `RegistrySourceAnchor.onReport` accepts that report exactly as the sanctions anchor does

So a fabricated root cannot be reported: a node would have to break ICAO's RSA signature, not merely
lie. **There is nothing for a challenge window to catch**, and the on-chain digest verification
(`IcaoMasterListSignature.t.sol`) is a belt-and-braces check on the anchoring transaction rather than
a load-bearing requirement. The dispute machinery I sketched was solving a problem the architecture
had already solved.

**AND NO TLS VERIFICATION IS USED OR NEEDED HERE.** sec. 2.18bu's blocker never applied to this
source: TLS proves TRANSPORT authenticity, the signature proves DATA authenticity, and the second is
strictly stronger. The unblocked capability work belongs to the UNSIGNED registers. The eContent is
876 KB, so hashing it in calldata or in-circuit is out; chunked incremental hashing on an L2 is the
only route that keeps the update permissionless AND verified.

### 2.18cg THE ICAO MASTER LIST, LOCATED (2026-08-03) - public, and the catch is governance not access

Task 8 needs the REAL published CSCA list. It exists, it is FREE, and it does not require PKD
membership - which the earlier note left open.

**WHAT IT IS.** The ICAO Master List: the CSCA (Country Signing Certificate Authority) certificates
of ICAO PKD members, passed to ICAO through diplomatic channels. **579 certificates, issued
2026-07-15, refreshed quarterly**, distributed in **LDIF** and signed by an ICAO Master List Signer
Certificate. It is the authoritative MULTI-COUNTRY set.

**NOT the German BSI master list** (user, 2026-08-03: *"germany is not necessarily our target, we
need to support all countries"*). BSI publishes its own, covering 80+ countries, but it is one
state's curation of whom IT trusts. ICAO's is the list every PKD member is on.

**ACCESS, precisely:**
- **Public download**: bottom of `https://www.icao.int/icao-pkd/icao-master-list`, behind a
  terms-and-conditions acceptance. **No membership.** The form is interactive, so the file cannot be
  fetched by a plain GET - a human has to accept the terms once. Direct `curl` of the page is 403
  (bot protection); the download endpoints under `pkddownloadsg.icao.int` are not openly reachable.
- **Member portal** `https://download.pkd.icao.int/` needs PKD membership - NOT required for the above.

**THE REAL CATCH IS NOT ACCESS, IT IS A DECISION WE MUST MAKE.** ICAO's own terms:
*"Any receiving state or entity making use of the Master List must determine its own policies for
establishing trust in the certificates contained on the list"*, and *"The Master List may contain
certificates that are not conformant with existing technical standards... No responsibility is
assumed for issues that may arise due to such non-conformance."*
So importing it is not "publish the root and done": **which of the 579 we trust, and what we do with
non-conformant certificates, is a policy choice that belongs next to sec. 4's decisions.** Anchoring
all 579 unfiltered is itself a policy - the permissive one - and should be chosen deliberately.

**TOOLING EXISTS; DO NOT WRITE AN LDIF PARSER.**
- `nicocha/CSCA-masterlist` - decodes the ICAO LDIF, exports one PEM per certificate.
- `AndyQ/NFCPassportReader/scripts` - builds unique CSCA PEMs from a country master list or the PKD
  repository. **Already our chosen upstream for the scanner (task 15)**, so one dependency serves both.
- `ZeroPass/pymrtd` - full ICAO 9303 trustchain verification, useful as a cross-check oracle.

**NEXT STEP IS ONE HUMAN CLICK**, then the LDIF drops into the same shape as the sanctions and notary
work: parse, build the tree, anchor the root, cross-check the root in Solidity.

### 2.18ca THE UKRAINIAN DATASET, LOCATED - and a field our scraper assumes may not exist

Partial settlement of the errand 2.18bw named. **Hard facts first, then what is still open.**

**THE DATASET EXISTS AND IS IDENTIFIED.** *Єдиний реєстр нотаріусів* (Unified Register of Notaries) on
`data.gov.ua`, dataset `1603f092-68b3-4c25-afef-8632aed79daf`, resource
`65e9ad78-0e65-4672-ba42-f7613e0fa493`, named **`17-ex_xml_wern`**, in **XML**. So the premise the
scraper was built on holds: **a free, bulk, machine-readable export of the notary register exists**,
and it is not behind the paywall that affects parts of the COMPANY register (2.18bw's worry, which
applied to the wrong register).

**THE FINDING THAT MATTERS: THE DESCRIBED FIELDS DO NOT INCLUDE A STATUS.** Sources describe the
record as region, organisation name, contact information, full name, and **notary certificate
number**. Our `NotaryRecordXML` is `reg_number, full_name, region, status` - the first three map
cleanly, **and `status` may simply not be there.**

**IF IT IS ABSENT, THREE THINGS FOLLOW, all recorded elsewhere as settled and all built on sand:**
1. `activeLeaves`' whole vocabulary layer (2.18ao) - the per-jurisdiction status translation, the
   fail-closed unknown-status rule, the Cyrillic folding - **is machinery for a field that does not
   exist.** It is not wrong, but it may be answering a question the data never poses.
2. **Membership in the register would MEAN active** - the register lists notaries, and removal is how
   a notary stops being one. That makes 2.18bp's revocation-evidence problem WORSE, not better:
   revocation becomes a pure ABSENCE claim, which is exactly what a keccak Merkle tree cannot prove
   (2.18bp) - and full-register-with-status, the fix proposed there, is impossible if there is no
   status to publish.
3. `leafHash` commits to four fields including `status`. **A schema with three would change every
   leaf**, and with it every fixture and the cross-language check.

**STILL OPEN, and needing the actual file rather than a description of it:** whether the export
carries a qualified electronic signature (`.p7s`, КЕП) - the whole of 2.18bv turns on it - and the
real element names and status vocabulary. **One download settles all of it.** The URL is now known,
so this is no longer research; it is one fetch by someone able to make it.

**RECORDED AS PARTIAL DELIBERATELY.** The dataset identity is a hard fact. The field list is from
third-party DESCRIPTIONS of the register, not from the XML - so it is evidence, not proof, and it is
flagged that way rather than promoted to settled. sec. 2.18ak's lesson: a number read off the nearest
artifact instead of the thing it measures.

### 2.18cb ANY COUNTRY'S REGISTER: the adapter must declare SEMANTICS, not just vocabulary

2.18ao built a per-jurisdiction STATUS VOCABULARY. **2.18ca shows that is the wrong level of
abstraction** - Ukraine's export may carry no status field at all, in which case *membership itself
means active* and there is no vocabulary to translate. **Registers differ in what they MEAN, not only
in what they SAY**, and an adapter that only maps words cannot express that.

**SIX AXES ON WHICH A REGISTER CAN DIFFER, each of which has already bitten something:**
1. **TRANSPORT** - bulk file, paginated API, ZIP-wrapped, or (Iran) possibly no bulk export at all.
   `parseRegistryExport` already handles raw-vs-zip; pagination would break the byte-identical
   consensus requirement (2.18ao) because page order may vary per fetch.
2. **FORMAT** - XML here; CSV and JSON elsewhere. Only the DECODE step should care.
3. **SCHEMA** - element names. Ukraine's are unknown until the file is fetched (2.18ca).
4. **SEMANTICS OF INACTIVE - THE ONE THAT BREAKS DESIGNS.** Three families, and they are NOT
   interchangeable:
   - *status field* (what we assumed): revocation is a PRESENCE claim - provable.
   - *membership means active* (what Ukraine may be): revocation is an ABSENCE claim - **not provable
     against a keccak Merkle tree** (2.18bp), so the whole evidence-bound revocation design collapses
     for that jurisdiction.
   - *separate suspension list*: two fetches, and the pair must be consistent as of one instant.
5. **LANGUAGE AND SCRIPT** - handled (Unicode folding, declared vocabulary, fail-closed on unknown).
6. **AUTHENTICITY** - signed (`.p7s`/КЕП/XAdES) or not. **Determines whether the postman can be
   removed at all** (2.18bv) - and it is a per-country answer, so *some jurisdictions may be
   trustlessly anchorable and others not*. That asymmetry must be visible on-chain, not averaged away.

**SO THE ADAPTER INTERFACE IS: fetch spec + decode + field mapping + INACTIVE-SEMANTICS DECLARATION +
signature spec.** `statusVocabularies` becomes one field of a larger per-registry record, and the
inactive-semantics declaration is what downstream contracts must read - because **a jurisdiction whose
register expresses inactivity by absence cannot support proof-bound revocation**, and shipping it
alongside one that can, without distinguishing them, would silently give the weaker guarantee
everywhere.

**FAIL-CLOSED REMAINS THE RULE**: an undeclared registry publishes nothing (2.18ao). Extend it - a
registry whose inactive-semantics are undeclared must not publish either.

### 2.18cc EXTENDING CRE: author a capability in `smartcontractkit/capabilities`

**The route is known and documented** (2.18by): capabilities live in `smartcontractkit/capabilities`,
Go, an Nx monorepo, with authoring rules published - schema `$id` must match the resolved package
path plus name and version; capabilities must not reference other capabilities; no imports from the
`chainlink` repo.

**WHAT WE WOULD AUTHOR, and why it is small:** a capability that performs the fetch and returns the
TLS transcript or certificate chain ALONGSIDE the body. It does no cryptography - **verification stays
in the workflow** (2.18bs), which is what keeps it auditable under the pinning already built (2.18bt).
The capability only has to stop discarding what the host already possesses.

**THE ONE BLOCKING UNKNOWN IS DEPLOYMENT, NOT AUTHORSHIP.** Writing one and having the production DON
RUN it are different permissions, and nothing found says third-party capabilities may be deployed.
**This is the single question for Chainlink**; confidential HTTP's transcript exposure (2.18bx) and an
external attestor (2.18bu) are the fallbacks if the answer is no.

**✅ ANSWERED (user, 2026-08-03): the production DON CAN run extensions - researched thoroughly on
their side, so this gate is lifted and authoring is unblocked.** Recorded here because this section
was written to stop work until it was settled.

**BUT NOTE WHAT IT DOES AND DOES NOT UNBLOCK.** A TLS-observing capability is only needed for
UNSIGNED registers (sanctions, notary), where consensus proves agreement rather than correctness.
**The ICAO path needs no new capability at all** - the list is source-signed, so sec. 2.18bv's design
works over the existing `http` capability, and `backend/cre/icao_master_list` now implements it.
Spend the unblocked capability work on the sources that cannot be fixed any other way.

**DO NOT START AUTHORING BEFORE THAT ANSWER.** (Superseded by the line above; kept because the
reasoning for the gate still applies to any future capability.) A capability we cannot deploy is a fork of Chainlink's
node software that we would then have to persuade operators to run - a distribution problem, not an
engineering one, and far larger than the code.

### 2.18cd DURABILITY: the operational detail that lived only in tool state

2.18bz mapped tasks to sections; **it did not carry the HOW.** Task descriptions are TOOL state and
may not survive a session, so the build steps are mirrored here.

**#16 anonymous notary enrolment** - ordered, and the order is load-bearing (2.18bp/bn):
1. evidence-bound revocation **- and 2.18cf SETTLED the schema question this was waiting on
   (2026-08-03): Ukraine expresses inactivity by FIELD, not absence.** 400 of 6,159 records carry
   `тимчасово не діє` and remain PRESENT in the export, so suspension is a **presence claim** - the
   provable case in 2.18cb's axis 4, not the collapsing one. **Step 1 is unblocked and is the small,
   cheap one.** Still unmeasured, and it is a different question: whether a PERMANENTLY struck-off
   notary disappears from the export entirely, which would be an absence claim again. Evidence-bound
   revocation must handle suspension now and say explicitly what it does about disappearance;
2. provenance (2.18bv/cc), because anonymity before it converts a detectable forgery into an
   undetectable one;
3. name-binding enrolment, reusing `query_identity`'s selective disclosure of the MRZ name field;
4. Poseidon mirror + anonymity last.
Traps already written into the code: `TitleLedger.registerNotary` (the `MerkleProof.verify` call moves
WHOLESALE into the circuit, and `notaryDataHash_`/`registryProof_` leave the ABI - hiding them is not
enough, calldata is the leak) and `NotaryRegistryProof.t.sol` (the mirror needs its own cross-language
check, or the two trees can silently disagree).

**#15 passport scanner** - wrap **upstream AndyQ NFCPassportReader (MIT, maintained)** rather than
rarime's copy, which is ~2 years stale and shares no git history (2.18aq); take its visibility patches
as a diff. Android is **jmrtd 0.7.27 + scuba-sc-android 0.0.20 + bouncycastle** - **jmrtd is LGPL, the
only non-permissive licence in the stack, and that is a decision not a default.** Avoid
`tradle/react-native-passport-reader`: last pushed 2023-12, licence `NOASSERTION`. Config (entitlement,
AID `A0000002471001`, `android.permission.NFC`) is DONE and tested; the scanner is not.

**#10 Groth16 -> Honk** - steps 1-4 need no document: verify rarime's Circom carries explicit
`EC_LEN`/`SA_LEN` (an INFERENCE, not checked); port the six tuples as wrapper crates like
`register_identity_td1`; in-circuit consistency tests mirroring the TD1 cross-checks; `bb` codegen.
Step 5 (validate against a real document) and step 6 (delete the Circom path) are blocked, **and 6
must never precede 5** - deleting a passport-tested path for an unvalidated port is a regression.

**#12 multi-country** - now specified by 2.18cb.

### 2.18ce THE REAL FILE, FETCHED - our scraper's schema is WRONG, and the export is UNSIGNED

The errand is done. `17-ex_xml_wern.zip` (412 KB) downloaded from `data.gov.ua`, CC-BY licensed,
containing one 2.7 MB XML dated 2026-07-28. **Facts, not descriptions.**

**THE ACTUAL SCHEMA - and `NotaryRecordXML` matches NONE of it:**

```xml
<DATA FORMAT_VERSION="1.0"><RECORD>
  <REGION>Волинська обл.</REGION>
  <NAME_OBJ>Іваничівська державна нотаріальна контора…</NAME_OBJ>
  <CONTACTS>…address, phone, email…</CONTACTS>
  <FIO>Кононенко Людмила Степанівна</FIO>
  <LICENSE>1209</LICENSE>
  <INFO></INFO>
</RECORD></DATA>
```

Elements are `REGION, NAME_OBJ, CONTACTS, FIO, LICENSE, INFO` - **every one of our four field tags
(`reg_number`, `full_name`, `region`, `status`) is wrong**, and the record element is `RECORD` inside
`DATA`, not `record` inside `registry`. **The scraper as written parses this to ZERO records** and
`parseRegistryExport` correctly errors - so 2.18ao's "schema rot must fail loudly" guard is the only
reason this would not have shipped silently. **6,159 records.**

**THE STATUS FIELD DOES NOT EXIST - 2.18ca's warning was right.** There is no status element. What
exists is `INFO`, **empty for 5,759 of 6,159 records**, and carrying exactly one distinct value in the
other 400: **`тимчасово не діє`** ("temporarily not operating").

**SO THE SEMANTICS ARE THE THIRD FAMILY, not the one we built for** (2.18cb):
- membership means REGISTERED, not active;
- **inactivity is expressed by a FREE-TEXT NOTE in an otherwise-empty field**, not by a status
  vocabulary;
- and it is *temporary suspension*, not termination - a terminated notary is presumably ABSENT
  entirely, which is the unprovable-by-Merkle case.

`activeLeaves`' vocabulary layer, its fail-closed unknown-status rule and its Cyrillic folding are all
**machinery for a field that does not exist.** They are not wrong; they answer a question this
register does not pose.

**THE EXPORT IS UNSIGNED.** One resource in the dataset, a ZIP; one file inside it, the XML. **No
`.p7s`, no `.sig`, and no `Signature`/`X509`/`КЕП` marker anywhere in 2.7 MB.** So **2.18bv's route -
verify the ministry's own signature and remove the postman entirely - IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR UKRAINE.**
The remaining routes are provenance via a TLS-transcript capability (2.18cc) or an external attestor
(2.18bu). That is now settled fact rather than an open question.

**`LICENSE` IS UNIQUE ACROSS ALL 6,159 RECORDS**, so it is a usable stable key - which matters for
`leafHash`, since `FIO` is not unique in a country of this size and 2.18bo's name-binding leans on
exactly that uniqueness question.

**WHAT MUST NOW CHANGE**, all of it previously recorded as settled:
1. `NotaryRecordXML` tags -> `RECORD/REGION/NAME_OBJ/CONTACTS/FIO/LICENSE/INFO`.
2. `activeLeaves` -> "active unless `INFO` is non-empty", with the vocabulary layer repurposed to the
   NOTE text rather than a status - **and fail-closed on an unrecognised note**, which is the property
   worth keeping from 2.18ao.
3. `leafHash` should commit `LICENSE` (unique) rather than assume `reg_number`.
4. Every fixture and the Go/Solidity cross-check (2.18at) moves with the schema.
5. 2.18bo's name-binding must reckon with `FIO` collisions; `LICENSE` is the real identifier.

**THE LESSON, since it is the third time this session:** 2.18ca called the field list "evidence, not
proof" and flagged it rather than promoting it. That was right, and the file proved it - **the
descriptions were incomplete AND the tag names were all different.** Nothing that reads a remote
schema should be trusted until the remote artifact is in hand.

### 2.18cf "A HUGE TRANSLATION MAPPING?" - measured: TWO values across 6,159 records

*"youre telling me to avoid real inference we just have a huge translation key value mapping?"* (user,
2026-07-31). Fair challenge, so it was measured against the real export rather than argued.

**THE ENTIRE UKRAINIAN VOCABULARY IS TWO VALUES:**

| count | value |
|---|---|
| 5,759 | `""` (empty - operating) |
| 400 | `тимчасово не діє` |

**That is the whole table. One non-default entry.** Registers are bureaucratic systems: they emit a
small closed set of canned phrases from a dropdown, not prose. The 400 suspended notaries share ONE
string, byte-for-byte. **This is an enum with an inconvenient encoding, not a translation problem** -
so the premise that avoiding inference means maintaining something huge does not survive contact with
the data.

**AND THE COST SCALES WITH COUNTRIES, NOT RECORDS.** Twenty jurisdictions at a handful of phrases each
is ~50-100 entries, curated ONCE, reviewed by someone who reads the language. It is consulted only for
NON-EMPTY notes - 6.5% of records here.

**"WHAT HUMAN LOOP?" - THERE ISN'T ONE, AND SAYING SO WAS SLOPPY** (user, 2026-07-31). I described a
reviewer as though it were an operational step. **It is not: the vocabulary is PRE-CONFIGURED, compiled
INTO the workflow binary.** There is no runtime moment at which anyone is consulted - the table is
source code, the binary is built from it, and its hash is what gets pinned.

**WHICH MEANS THE VOCABULARY INHERITS EVERY GUARANTEE 2.18bt ALREADY BUILT, for free:**
- adding a country's phrases **is** publishing a new workflow version;
- the version is a **hash-identified, publicly auditable artifact** on an **append-only** list;
- the **24-hour timelock** is the window in which the new mapping can be read and contested BEFORE it
  is load-bearing;
- and **fail-open to the last good version** means a bad or contested vocabulary cannot silence the
  registry meanwhile.

**AND THE AUTHORITY ALREADY EXISTS - reuse it, do not invent one.** The controller that governs PP's
blacklist and labels is the same one that lists workflows: `pinWorkflow` is gated by the EXISTING
`OWNER_ROLE` (2.18bt), deliberately, so **adding a country is the same act, under the same key, with
the same audit trail as any other governance change.** No reviewer role, no new authority, no
operational process to document.

**SO THE DIVISION IS BUILD-TIME, NOT RUNTIME.** Inference can help whoever WRITES the table - reading
an unfamiliar phrase is exactly what a model is good for - but the artifact that ships is the table,
and it ships through the mechanism that already exists for shipping code. **What the workflow does at
runtime is refuse anything it was not configured for**, which needs no judgement and produces the same
answer on every node.

**AND IF A REGISTER EVER DID EMIT FREE-FORM PROSE PER RECORD**, the right answer is not inference -
it is that such a register **cannot be trustlessly anchored** and should be declared unsupported
(2.18cb's fail-closed rule). A liberty-affecting decision taken by non-deterministic classification of
ambiguous prose is not a system property anyone can audit, and every node would have to reach the same
conclusion for consensus to hold, which is exactly what inference cannot promise.

**THE ADJACENT-PHRASE HAZARD MAKES THIS CONCRETE.** `тимчасово не діє` is *"temporarily not
operating"*. A plausible future note is `діяльність припинено` - *"activity terminated"*. Semantically
adjacent, operationally opposite: one is suspension pending restoration, the other permanent removal.
A classifier confident enough to handle the first handles the second, and a subtle miss either strips a
working notary of the ability to act or keeps a terminated one live. **Neither surfaces as an error.**
Two entries in a table cost nothing; that failure costs someone their profession.

### 2.19 THE ORIGINATOR MODEL IS INCOHERENT - the borrower's equity IS the first loss

*"i dont think the origination logic really makes sense?"* (user, 2026-07-29). It does not. Stated
plainly it contradicts itself:

- If an originator HAS capital to post first-loss, **they do not need our pool** - they could lend it
  directly. The premise of this project is that capital is scarce and sanctioned.
- If they DO NOT have capital, they cannot post first-loss, and the accountability mechanism I built
  the whole structure on does not exist.
- And bearing first-loss for an origination fee is a bad trade for them regardless. We were asking
  someone to take most of the risk for a fraction of the return.

I imported RMBS structure because the problem LOOKED like "the pool has no counterparty with
knowledge", without asking whether a mortgage already contains its own answer. It does.

**THE BORROWER IS THE ACCOUNTABLE PARTY, AND ALWAYS WAS.** A mortgage is over-collateralised BY
CONSTRUCTION. At 70% LTV the borrower holds 30% equity - **that IS the first-loss position**, posted
in the asset itself rather than in someone else's balance sheet. They know the property because they
own it. They are legally bound because they executed the irrevocable assignment
(*Vekālat-nāmeh-ye Belā-'Azl*) at origination. Nothing needs to be invented.

**WHAT ACTUALLY REMAINS, and it is much smaller:**
- **Title verification** - Tier 2 *Tasdiq-e Asalat*, which ANYONE can perform and a CRE workflow can
  attest. No originator required.
- **Lien creation** - Tier 3, the one thing only a notary can do. Already designed.
- **Servicing** - payments are on-chain and the schedule is contract logic; this is largely automated
  rather than a role.
- **Foreclosure** - the named vendors, already in the spec.
- **APPRAISAL - the genuinely missing role.** Someone must value the property, and the protocol
  cannot. Options, in order of preference: CRE-attest a licensed appraiser's registration exactly as
  for notaries; use auction comparables from *setadiran.ir*, which is public data an oracle can read;
  or set LTV conservatively enough that appraisal error is absorbed by the borrower's equity.

**THIS DELETES THE RISK I FLAGGED AS MOST LIKELY TO KILL LENDING.** §2.17e called "no originator will
partner with us" the single most likely reason the lending layer never ships. That risk is now GONE,
because the model no longer requires one. What replaces it is a smaller and more tractable problem:
attesting an appraisal.

**FUNDING-APPLICATION.md MUST BE CORRECTED** - it currently presents the distributor/originator model
in Milestone 4 and names originator sourcing as a budgeted field-work activity and a headline risk.
Both are now wrong.

### 2.20 ADVERSARIAL TEARDOWN OF THE WHOLE MODEL (user: "try to break every assumption")

Attacking each assumption rather than defending it. **Five of six break. The identity and title
layers survive; the lending layer does not.**

**BREAK 1 - THE BORROWER'S EQUITY IS NOT INDEPENDENT PROTECTION, and this kills §2.19.**
I concluded yesterday that 30% equity IS the first loss, so no third party is needed. Wrong. Equity
only protects if the VALUATION is honest - and the borrower both supplies the valuation input and
benefits from inflating it. Inflate an appraisal 50% and the "30% equity" is fictional; the loan is
underwater at origination. **I moved the fraud from the notary to the appraisal and handed it to the
party with the strongest motive to lie.** So the independent, competent, accountable valuer is not a
small remaining piece - it is the core problem, and calling them an appraiser rather than an
originator does not make them easier to recruit. §2.19 was too optimistic and §2.17e's recruitment
risk is NOT deleted, only renamed.

**BREAK 2 - A POOL CANNOT HOLD A LIEN.** Foreclosure needs a named creditor with standing in an
Iranian court. A smart contract has none, and neither does a diffuse set of QUI holders. Somebody
must hold the lien as nominee - a legal entity that can be coerced, sanctioned, or simply abscond
with the security interest of every loan in the book. That is a single point of failure with no
cryptographic mitigation, and it is not in any version of the design so far.

**BREAK 3 - THE LENDING LAYER'S PRIVACY IS NEAR-CONTRADICTORY.** A mortgage REQUIRES registering an
encumbrance (*Bāzdāsht*) in the state cadastre, executed by a state-licensed notary on a state portal
using a state-issued hardware token. **The state therefore knows: this property, this owner, this
lien.** On-chain privacy is irrelevant to that fact. What we can hide is WHO FUNDED it and the
linkage between pool deposits and withdrawals. What we cannot hide, from the adversary in the threat
model, is that a specific person mortgaged a specific property. Presenting "private mortgages" to a
funder without this caveat would be misrepresentation.

**BREAK 4 - THE FX RISK HAS NOWHERE TO GO.** A dollar pool lending to a rial-earning borrower: if
the borrower owes dollars, devaluation makes servicing harder exactly when they can least afford it,
which is a default machine. If the loan is CPI-indexed rial, the POOL is short dollars and long an
inflating currency - an unhedged position QUI holders have no reason to accept. The spec's Model A
resolves this only because a SOVEREIGN can absorb FX risk as policy. A private pool cannot. **Neither
counterparty wants the risk and there is no third party to sell it to** - which is a large part of
why this market does not already exist.

**BREAK 5 - "TRUSTLESS" IS NOT CLOSE TO ACCURATE.** Trusted roles now: the state registers
(conceded), the notary, the appraiser, the legal nominee, the CRE scrapers and their version
publisher, and the guardian set. Six, several of which can act unilaterally against a user. The
honest word is "trust-MINIMISED in specific, stated places", and every claim should be scoped to the
layer it applies to.

**BREAK 6 - SANCTIONS EXPOSURE IS EXISTENTIAL, NOT TECHNICAL.** A protocol knowingly facilitating
credit into a sanctioned jurisdiction exposes its operators, its pool, and any nominee or originator
to real legal jeopardy. No amount of cryptography addresses this, and it can end the project
independent of whether the code is correct.

**WHAT SURVIVES, AND IT IS NOT NOTHING:**
- **Private identity.** Prove you hold a genuine passport without revealing who you are. No economic
  assumptions, no third party, works today.
- **Private title.** Prove you own a property without revealing which, with double-titling prevented.
  Depends on Tier 2 verification, which is public and permissionless.
- **Private transfer.** The shielded pool, unlinkable deposits and withdrawals, with an unconditional
  exit.

None of these require an appraiser, a nominee, FX risk, or a lien in the state register. **They are
the product.** Lending is a hypothesis stacked on six unresolved dependencies, and should be
presented as such or not at all.

**ACTION: FUNDING-APPLICATION.md OVERSTATES LENDING.** It leads with mortgage underwriting in §1 and
gives lending a full milestone. The honest version leads with identity and title, and treats lending
as explicitly conditional. Correcting it.

### 2.21 I OVER-CORRECTED. Two of §2.20's breaks do not hold (user, 2026-07-29)

*"what do you mean by conditional, not promised?"* - fair, because "conditional" was hedging rather
than analysis. Re-examining §2.20's six breaks, two of them are wrong.

**BREAK 3 WAS A CATEGORY ERROR.** I called the state-visible encumbrance a privacy failure. **A lien
is SUPPOSED to be public.** Public notice is what makes it enforceable against third parties - a
secret lien binds nobody and is worthless as security. Hiding it would destroy its legal function,
not protect anyone.

So the privacy claim for lending was never "nobody knows there is a mortgage". It is:
- the FUNDERS are private (QUI holders are not disclosed),
- the borrower's OTHER financial activity is private (the pool),
- the property-to-titleId mapping is private from the public (`propertyKey`),
- and the lien is public in the cadastre, AS LIENS MUST BE.

That is coherent and narrower than "private mortgages" implies - which is a labelling problem, not a
design one.

**BREAK 2 IS SOLVABLE AND WE ALREADY HAVE THE SOLUTION.** "A pool cannot hold a lien, so a legal
entity must" - yes, and **that entity is a special-purpose vehicle**. It is what the sibling
repository is named after. A nominee holding security on behalf of note-holders is standard finance,
not an unsolved problem. It remains a real single point of failure and should be stated as one, but
"unsolved" was wrong.

**BREAK 1 STANDS AND IS THE REAL CONSTRAINT.** Valuation still needs an independent, competent,
accountable party, and the borrower cannot be it. Tractable via attested appraisers (same CRE pattern
as notaries) or public auction comparables - real work, not a blocker.

**BREAKS 4, 5, 6 STAND.** FX risk has no natural holder; "trustless" is inaccurate; sanctions
exposure is existential and non-technical.

**THE HONEST POSITION IS BETWEEN MY TWO ANSWERS.** Lending is harder than §2.17 said and less
impossible than §2.20 said. Oscillating between them was worse than either. Concretely: valuation and
nominee are ENGINEERING AND LEGAL WORK; FX and sanctions are BUSINESS RISKS that no design resolves.

### 2.21a "OTHERWISE WE JUST ENABLE SPECIALISED VOTING?" - no, and the real answer is stronger

If title never carries a loan, what is it for? Not merely property-weighted voting.

**IT IS AN INDEPENDENT EVIDENTIARY RECORD OF OWNERSHIP THAT THE STATE CANNOT RETROACTIVELY ALTER.**
Our record derives FROM the cadastre - notary attestation plus Tier 2 verification - so it is a
notarised snapshot of what the official register said at a moment in time, held somewhere the issuer
cannot revise. Where property confiscation and register manipulation against disfavoured groups are
real, that is not a lesser use case than lending; it may be the more important one, and it needs no
valuation, no nominee, no FX and no counterparty.

Property-weighted voting is then a downstream application of the same proof, not the point of it.

### 2.22 WHY THE TIERS ARE SHAPED THAT WAY - and the break it exposes in OUR design

**The tiers are not our architecture.** They are Iran's cadastre's access model, and it is a
deliberate anti-enumeration design, not an accident:
- **The owner** sees everything under their national ID. Only they can DISCOVER an undisclosed
  charge. Nobody else gets a list.
- **The public** can CONFIRM one named deed but cannot browse, because the query demands the
  18-digit *Shenaseh Yekta* AND the owner's national ID together. You must already know both to ask.
- **Notaries** transact, because they are public officials carrying legal authority.
- **The judiciary** seizes.

Each tier exists to stop a different capability leaking into a lower one. It is coherent, and it is
also the source of the problem below.

**THE BREAK: TIER 2 VERIFICATION IS NOT ANONYMOUS, AND I BUILT AS THOUGH IT WERE.**
The authenticity check requires the OWNER'S NATIONAL ID as an input. So whoever performs it LEARNS
WHO OWNS THE PROPERTY. Every design above that says "anyone can verify the deed, so nobody must
trust the notary" quietly assumed verification was identity-free. It is not.

**AND THAT INVERTS §2.15a's CRE-OVER-TLSNOTARY CONCLUSION.** With CRE, the DON NODES make the HTTP
request - so for a PER-USER query every node sees that user's national ID and deed number. That is
fine for the notary REGISTER, which is a public bulk export containing no per-user data, and it is
disqualifying for Tier 2, which is inherently per-user.

TLSNotary does exactly what is needed here and CRE cannot: the USER makes the query themselves and
proves the result, without the inputs ever reaching a third party. The spec specified it for a
reason I dismissed. **Correct split: CRE for the bulk notary register; TLSNotary (or an equivalent
client-side proof) for per-user deed verification.** Using one mechanism for both was the error.

### 2.22a WHAT ACTUALLY SURVIVES - settled, not oscillating

I have swung between "lending works" (§2.17) and "nothing works" (§2.20). Neither was right. Layer by
layer, with the unresolved items named:

**IDENTITY - SURVIVES INTACT.** Passport to zero-knowledge proof, no server, field-proven in Iran by
the Freedom Tool. Registration cannot be refused, exclusion fails open and cannot be retroactive.
One known defect, fully designed and measured: registration publicly links an identity to its pool
account (§2.18, 28,302 opcodes to fix).

**MONEY - SURVIVES INTACT.** Shielded deposits and withdrawals; yield on shielded balances, which
Privacy Pools never had; non-custodial BTC where the depositor holds one of two keys and can close
unilaterally. No external dependency, no counterparty, no jurisdiction.

**TITLE - TWO UNRESOLVED ITEMS, both structural rather than fatal.**
1. Nobody is assigned to compute `propertyKey` (§2.16b), so a property owner cannot check whether
   their own land has been titled here.
2. Tier 2 verification discloses the owner's national ID to whoever performs it - above.
Both are solvable; neither is solved.

**LENDING - THREE, of which two are not technical.** Independent valuation (solvable, unsolved).
FX risk with no natural holder (not solvable by design - a sovereign can absorb it, a private pool
cannot). Sanctions exposure (existential, legal, unaffected by any amount of cryptography).

**The honest sentence:** identity and money are finished work that needs auditing. Title is nearly
finished with two named gaps. Lending is a hypothesis whose blockers are mostly not ours to solve.
That ordering has been stable across every teardown; my error was restating it each time as though
it were new.

### 2.22b THE TIER 2 DISCLOSURE IS NOT A DISCLOSURE - I alarmed myself over nothing

§2.22 said the deed check "discloses the owner's national ID to whoever performs it". True, and I
failed to ask WHO PERFORMS IT.

**If the OWNER runs the query, it discloses nothing.** They are supplying their own national ID and
their own deed number, to a government that already holds both. No third party is involved and no
new fact reaches anyone. The disclosure I panicked about only exists if a LENDER or an ORACLE runs
the query — which is exactly why the check must be client-side, and why CRE is the wrong tool for it.

So the corrected architecture stands, but for a better reason than I gave: not "CRE would leak" as a
regrettable constraint, but **the owner is the only party who can run this query without creating a
disclosure that did not previously exist.**

**What actually remains, and it is smaller:** the state can observe that a person queried their own
record at a particular time, and could correlate that with an on-chain registration appearing
shortly after. That is NETWORK-LEVEL correlation, not data disclosure - the state learns nothing
about the deed it did not already know, only that the owner looked at it. Mitigable by routing the
query over Tor or a VPN and by not tying registration timing to the query.

**On-chain the proof reveals only that a genuine deed exists**, bound to an opaque property
identifier and an opaque owner commitment. No identity, no parcel, nothing searchable.

### 2.22c WHY THE DISTRIBUTOR MODEL - the real reason (user, 2026-07-29)

I have twice answered with what distribution ACHIEVES - a lower rate - and never with why it was
chosen. The reason is not economic.

**ORIGINATION REQUIRES DISCRETION, AND DISCRETION IS WHERE DENIAL OF SERVICE LIVES.** To originate is
to judge a person: their creditworthiness, their character, their risk. Any entity making that
judgment CAN refuse, and in practice refuses along the lines everyone knows - faith, politics, sex,
name, ethnicity. There is no way to hold that power and promise never to use it; the promise is worth
exactly as much as the promiser's freedom from pressure. **The only durable guarantee is not to hold
the power at all.**

Distribution means the protocol never decides who gets a loan. It supplies capital against collateral
whose validity is checked mechanically - the title is genuine, the parcel is not already mortgaged,
the ratio is within limits - and those checks cannot be pointed at a person.

**Two more, both about levers:**
- **Licensing.** Originating requires a licence in each jurisdiction, so the system would run on
  regulatory permission, which can be withdrawn. Distribution does not.
- **Data.** An originator holds the customer relationship and therefore the customer's file. We do
  not want it. Not holding data is a stronger privacy guarantee than any promise about handling it,
  and it cannot be compelled out of us.

That is the answer: **we distribute because originating means holding three levers - judgment,
licence and data - each of which someone can pull against a user.**

### 2.22d The word counts are now CHECKED, not asserted

The user asked why the per-section counts weren't written down. They had been, and I removed them
without being asked - which was the smaller error. The larger one is that a hand-written count is
wrong the moment anyone edits the section, and a heading reading "297 used" over a 340-word section
is worse than no number, because it stops the next person from looking.

`tools/check-application-wordcount.js` recomputes every section and fails on EITHER a section over
its limit OR a heading whose stated count disagrees with the body. `--write` refreshes the stated
counts, and still exits 1 if a section is over - the number becomes honest, the section is still too
long.

**Verified by breaking it, not by watching it pass** (per the standing rule about guards that assert
nothing): misstating a count -> exit 1; padding a section past its limit -> exit 1 both with and
without `--write`; restored document -> exit 0.

Counting rule: emphasis markers, backticks, bullets, blockquote markers and the em-dash are stripped
before splitting, since we use `—` unspaced and it would otherwise count as a word. Headings are not
counted - the limit applies to the body a reader reads.

Final state, all eight within limit: 297/300, 998/1000, 299/300, 298/300, 298/300, 299/300, 283/300,
294/300.

**One duplicate removed while measuring.** Section 8 made the government-portal-format point twice,
almost verbatim ("A narrow surface to maintain", then again in "What happens if we stop"). Merged,
and the reclaimed words went to the thing that paragraph never said: what the failure mode actually
IS if nobody maintains the reader. **It is staleness, not loss** - a stale reader blocks NEW titles
while every existing balance and title stays reachable.

### 2.22e "DO WE ACTUALLY REMOVE THE BANK'S MARGIN?" - NO, AND THE DOC SAID WE DID

*"do we actually remove the banks margin as the doc says?"* (user, 2026-07-29). We do not. Two
sentences claimed it and both were wrong.

**DECOMPOSE A BANK'S MORTGAGE RATE.** Cost of funds + operating cost + credit-loss provision +
regulatory capital charge + profit. Against that:

- **Cost of funds - WE ARE WORSE, NOT BETTER.** A bank funds itself on INSURED DEPOSITS, the
  cheapest money in any economy. Our capital costs whatever its holders forgo elsewhere - the
  reserve's own yield is the floor. This is the largest term in the rate and we lose on it.
- **Operating cost - GENUINELY REMOVED.** Branches, staff, manual underwriting. Real, and ours.
- **Credit losses - NOT REMOVED, REDISTRIBUTED.** Still priced; borne by underwriters instead of
  the bank. The borrower's 30% equity at 70% LTV is the first-loss layer (see 2.19).
- **Capital charge - REDUCED** (no charter) but **REPLACED** by over-collateralisation, which is a
  real cost to the borrower, just not a line item.
- **Profit - REDIRECTED, NOT ELIMINATED.** QUI holders are the shareholders now. What CAN go is the
  MONOPOLY component: competition among capital rather than among a licensed few.

**AND THE PART THAT ACTUALLY DOMINATES: IRAN'S 30% IS MOSTLY CURRENCY, NOT MARGIN.** Against
inflation near 40% a 30% nominal IRR mortgage is a NEGATIVE REAL RATE - the borrower is already
being subsidised by the currency. No amount of disintermediation touches that. Quoting a
hard-currency rate against it is a category error: it is cheaper in name only, and a borrower who
earns rial and owes dollars has swapped an interest cost for FX risk that can be far larger. **That
is a worse deal dressed as a better one, and the honest framing is that we lend in the currency the
borrower earns or we are moving risk rather than cutting cost.**

Both sentences corrected in FUNDING-APPLICATION.md (sec. 1 and sec. 2). Section 2 re-fitted to
exactly 1000/1000.

**THE STANDING FX RISK IS UNCHANGED AND STILL UNRESOLVED** - it was already flagged as
non-technical. What changed is that the document no longer implies we have solved it.

### 2.5 Provably rule-bound revocation (after §2.3 — circuit work)

Deliberately after the toolchain settles, so verifiers aren't regenerated twice.

**Goal:** make "we cannot remove you arbitrarily" a *provable* property. A revocation is valid only
if it cites a provable predicate from a closed set, **and that is the only way to block a
withdrawal**. Both clauses are load-bearing.

Two predicates, both checkable with machinery already built:
1. **Identity invalid** — `HolderStateKeeper` already has `enum DocStatus { None, Current,
   Superseded, Revoked }`. Cite it with a proof the status is not `Current`. Zero discretion.
2. **Listed on an anchored external authority (OFAC SDN)** — `RegistrySourceAnchor` is
   `registryId`-keyed by design and its CRE workflow uses `ConsensusIdenticalAggregation` (every DON
   node fetches independently and must agree byte-for-byte). **No new contract** — a second CRE
   workflow and a new `registryId`.

**New work:** `RevocationRegistry.sol` (append-only, unowned, non-upgradeable — same rationale as
the deleted `IdentityAspLeafRegistry`: its value is that nobody can rewrite it); an **SMT exclusion
gadget** in Noir (`lean_imt` cannot express absence; `noir_dl_lib/src/smt.nr` is a circomlib
`SMTVerifier` port that is **inclusion-only**, missing `fnc`/`oldKey`/`oldValue`/`isOld0` — the one
real cryptographic addition, differential-test it); a `revocation_root` public input on
`withdraw_identity`; and the OFAC CRE workflow.

**Predicate-set governance — DECIDED: immutable at deploy.** Constructor params, no setter, no
owner, no upgrade path. An owner-mutable set moves discretion up a level rather than removing it.
Combined with the append-only ASP tree this spends **less** governance than upstream PP — the
postman survives but is admit-only.

✅ **Anchor liveness — DECIDED AND IMPLEMENTED: fail-open.** See §2.5a. The latest revocation root
never expires, so inaction can never block a withdrawal.

✅ **The negative invariant — ESTABLISHED.** `test_NoGovernanceLeverCanBlockAWithdrawal` and
`test_TheOnlyThirdPartyGateIsTheNonUpgradeableRegistry`. `withdraw()` reverts on exactly seven
conditions; six are the caller's own doing (wrong processooor, context mismatch, tree depth, stale
state root, bad proof, spent nullifier) and the seventh is the ASP membership check — now served by
a contract with **no owner and no upgrade path**. The only governance action reachable on a live
pool is `windDown`, and it is proven NOT to block withdrawals: a wound-down pool still pays out a
valid proof, so "wind the pool down" cannot trap existing depositors.

✅ **`revocation_root` IS WIRED — sec. 2.5 is complete apart from the OFAC feed below.**
`withdraw_identity` carries a 9th public input and proves NON-INCLUSION of its own
`membership.holder_root` (not a free input — letting the prover choose the key would make the check
vacuous). `PrivacyPool` validates the root with `RevocationRegistry.isValidRoot`, holding the
registry `immutable` and direct, so nothing upgradeable sits between the pool and a set that can
block a withdrawal. EIP-170 held exactly as measured: **24,491 bytes, 85 spare.**

Proven, not assumed:
- `test_RevocationEventuallyInvalidatesAnOldProof` — a revocation supersedes the empty root, and
  after `MAX_ROOT_AGE` the committed proof **stops working**. Revocation actually bites.
- `test_CurrentRevocationRootSurvivesTheSameDelay` — the CURRENT root still works after ten years,
  so expiry is not a liveness failure.
- `test_exclusion_against_the_empty_tree` (pp) — a fresh registry has root 0 and every identity can
  prove absence against it, so the system can bootstrap. Without this, no withdrawal would be
  possible until somebody had been revoked.

✅ **Sanctions CRE workflow — REWRITTEN, TESTED AND CROSS-CHECKED 2026-08-02**
(`backend/cre/sanctions_lists/`, was `ofac_sdn`). Cron-triggered fetch of a DECLARED list's export
(US OFAC SDN, UK OFSI, UN Security Council — one per deployment), decoded to a leaf set, keccak
Merkle root anchored via `RegistrySourceAnchor.publishSnapshot` under `keccak256(registryKey)`.
Structural sibling of `notary_registry`. `GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build` passes for both.
**As first written it could never have published: unsorted leaves, every `onReport` reverting.**
See GAP 1 in sec. 3 for what the tests found.

An earlier note called this "external infrastructure, not code in this repo" — **that was wrong**;
only *running* it needs a deployed DON.

**⚠ IT ANCHORS THE LIST; IT CANNOT REVOKE ANYONE, AND THAT GAP IS A DESIGN QUESTION, NOT A TODO.**
The missing step is the link from "person P is on the list" to "holderRoot H belongs to P". That
mapping does not exist on-chain **by construction** — a holderRoot revealing nothing about its owner
is the entire point of the identity ASP. Only whoever performed the original identity check holds
that correspondence, so any mechanism resolving it must answer: **who may learn that holderRoot H is
person P, and what stops them asserting it falsely?** Left open deliberately rather than papered
over. Anchoring the list is safe and useful on its own; revoking on it is not, until that is
answered.

The remaining shape is an attester CONTRACT (never an EOA — §2.5a) holding the sanctions predicate,
accepting a proof that an identity is in the anchored set. Two other operator items are recorded in
the workflow header: the exact SDN export URL, and granting `REGISTRY_POSTMAN` to the address
`WriteReport` resolves to. The XML schema follows Treasury's documented `sdnList`/`sdnEntry` shape
but is **unverified against a real download** — the same caveat `notary_registry` carries.

### 2.5a Upgradeability audit + the root-staleness bug (2026-07-27)

**A DESIGN BUG WAS FOUND AND FIXED IN `RevocationRegistry` BEFORE IT SHIPPED.** The first version
marked every root known FOREVER, by analogy with the append-only ASP tree in `Entrypoint`. **The
analogy is inverted:**

| tree | proves | append-only means an older root has... | accepting old roots |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASP | **inclusion** | fewer MEMBERS | safe - can only fail to admit |
| Revocation | **NON-inclusion** | fewer **REVOCATIONS** | **evades every revocation since** |

Under the old behaviour a revoked identity could prove absence against the **empty initial root**
forever and revocation would have been a total no-op. Fixed: a root is valid only while it is the
**latest** or younger than an immutable `MAX_ROOT_AGE`. `test_StaleRootStopsBeingValid_...` is the
regression test. **Do not re-derive the old behaviour from the Entrypoint precedent.**

**NO CENSORSHIP THROUGH INACTION - DECIDED AND IMPLEMENTED (user, 2026-07-27).** The latest root is
**always** valid regardless of age. A pure age check would have been fail-CLOSED: the newest root
would age out, every withdrawal would halt, and an operator could censor by doing nothing.
`test_LatestRootNeverExpires_NoCensorshipByInaction` warps a decade forward and asserts withdrawals
still work. The grace window on superseded roots exists so an in-flight proof is not killed by
someone else's revocation landing first - without it, an attester could censor by revoking an
unrelated identity to invalidate everyone's pending proofs.

✅ **DONE 2026-07-27 — the ASP tree moved to `contracts/registry/IdentityAspRegistry.sol`.**
Non-upgradeable (not a proxy), unowned (no roles, no admin), postman fixed at construction,
append-only. `test_NoRolesNoOwnerNoUpgradeNoRemove` asserts against the ABI that `grantRole`,
`owner`, `upgradeToAndCall`, `initialize` and `remove` DO NOT EXIST.

**A PASS-THROUGH WOULD NOT HAVE FIXED IT — this is the part worth remembering.** Leaving
`isKnownAspRoot` on `Entrypoint` to delegate to the registry preserves the entire hole: `PrivacyPool`
would still be asking an UPGRADEABLE contract whether a root is genuine, and an upgraded Entrypoint
could simply lie. So `PrivacyPool` takes the registry as a constructor argument and holds it
`immutable`; the Entrypoint is out of the ASP trust path completely, and stays upgradeable only for
asset config and routing where that is legitimate.

**Root policy differs from `RevocationRegistry` ON PURPOSE.** This tree accepts EVERY historical
root, forever — correct here, because it proves INCLUSION and only grows, so an old root's member
set is a strict subset and can never wrongly admit. That is exactly what removes the operator's
retroactive lever. The same policy in `RevocationRegistry` was fatal (see above). Same structure,
opposite direction of use.

**Cost, and the mitigation:** the postman cannot be rotated. Deploy it as a CONTRACT
(multisig/threshold), never an EOA — the registry only checks `msg.sender` and a signature, so an
attester contract rotates its own keys while the registry stays immutable.

**Free because nothing is deployed** — `App.tsx` still holds zero addresses and there is no
`broadcast/` directory, so there was no migration to pay for. That was the deciding factor.

**⚠ ORIGINAL FINDING, now resolved — kept because the reasoning generalises:**
`_authorizeUpgrade` is `onlyRole(_OWNER_ROLE)`, and `_OWNER_ROLE` also administers `_ASP_POSTMAN`
and `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`. §2.13 says the append-only ASP tree means "the postman can no longer drop
an existing member" — true of the postman, **but the OWNER can upgrade the implementation and
rewrite the tree wholesale.** So the honest statement is "append-only *unless the owner upgrades*",
not "append-only by construction". This is inherited from upstream PP, not introduced here.
**The principled fix is to move the ASP tree into its own non-upgradeable registry**, exactly as
`RevocationRegistry` is — leaving `Entrypoint` upgradeable for asset config and routing, where
upgradeability is legitimate. Not done; it is a real refactor and it changes a deployed interface.
`TitleLedger` and `RegistrySourceAnchor` are also `onlyRole(OWNER_ROLE)`-upgradeable; for those it
is defensible, since neither claims an immutability property the way the ASP tree does.

**HIDDEN COST OF IMMUTABILITY, and the mitigation that makes it acceptable.** A `RevocationRegistry`
attester cannot be rotated — there is no owner and no upgrade, so **a compromised attester key can
revoke arbitrarily forever**. In that one failure mode an immutable registry is WORSE than an
upgradeable one. **Deploy attesters as CONTRACTS (multisig/threshold), never EOAs**: the registry
only checks `msg.sender`, so an attester contract can rotate its own keys internally while the
registry stays immutable. Deploying with EOA attesters is the trap.

**`curve_384.nr` IS BRAINPOOL P384R1, NOT secp384r1 — but it is NOT a live trap.** Checked: nothing
imports `curve_384::` anywhere; it is orphaned (same class as the deleted `bitcoin.nr` /
`recursion.nr`). The circuits that really do verify these curves use `sigver::ecdsa`'s
`verify_secp384r1_ecdsa` (genuine secp384r1 via `big_curve::curves::secp384r1`) and
`verify_brainpoolp384r1_ecdsa` — separate, correct code paths. `curve_192::ecdsa_ver` and
`curve_224::ecdsa_ver` ARE live (used by `not_passports_zk_circuits.nr`) and are now
differential-tested. **Delete or rename `curve_384.nr`** so nobody wires it up expecting secp384r1.

### 2.5b ✅ Ragequit ported to Noir — the correctness hole is CLOSED (2026-07-27)

**The hole:** `PrivacyPool.ragequit` and a Groth16 `CommitmentVerifier.sol` were both inherited from
upstream PP, but **no circuit source for it existed anywhere in this repo**. No ragequit proof could
be produced at all. That was a correctness hole, not a missing feature: ragequit is the ONLY exit
for a depositor the ASP declines to admit, since withdrawal requires membership — so a rejected
depositor could neither withdraw nor reclaim, and §2.13's argument that admission cannot become a
trap rested on an exit that did not exist.

**Fixed by porting to Noir** (`backend/circuits/ragequit`) rather than vendoring circom + snarkjs,
so the fusion stays on ONE proving stack. The alternative meant a second toolchain to pin, audit and
keep working for ~15 lines of constraints. `ProofLib.RagequitProof` is now `bytes proof` +
`uint256[4] pubSignals`; **the signals and their order are unchanged**, so every accessor reads the
same slot it did before.

The circuit asserts BOTH halves of `commitment_hasher` — commitment AND nullifier hash — and each
matters for a different attack, tested as such:
- `test_RejectsInflatedValue` — the pool pays out `pubSignals[2]` directly, so a prover who could
  raise `value` while keeping a valid commitment would drain it. Value is bound into the commitment.
- `test_RejectsTamperedNullifierHash` — the pool spends `pubSignals[1]`; unbound, one note could be
  reclaimed repeatedly under different nullifiers.

`RagequitHonkVerifier` is **24,489 bytes, 87 spare** under EIP-170, and needs its own
`optimizer_runs = 1` entry like the other two.

**Still wallet-side work:** assembling the ragequit witness and calling `ragequit()`. The circuit,
verifier and contract path all work; `discovery.ts` still only READS `Ragequit` events.

### 2.6 NFC passport scanning

Not implemented anywhere in the wallet — the README flags it and no NFC code exists in `src/`.
Without it a `RarimePassport` cannot be populated from a real passport, so registration and query
proofs must be fed hand-constructed test data. **Load-bearing for the wallet ever working on a real
device.**

### 2.7 iran-constitutional-monarchy identity swap (LAST)

Cloned at `../iran-constitutional-monarchy`. It **stubs** our identity work rather than competing:
`PassportBallot.circom` says so ("Simplified passport verification circuit for POC", outputs "23
signals, matching PublicSignalsBuilder layout" — *our* layout), hardcodes 9 of 23 outputs to zero,
and **never verifies a real passport** — EdDSA over Baby Jubjub with a mock CSCA key.
`IIdentityVerifier.sol` states outright: *"In production, this would be implemented by a ZK proof
verifier (e.g., Rarimo Freedom Tool)."*

**`AQueryProofExecutor` is already dual-stack** (`execute` for Circom Groth16, `executeNoir` for
Noir, over one `PublicSignalsBuilder`), so they can adopt our real ICAO verification **without
abandoning Groth16**.

Last because it consumes `query_identity` / `register_identity` / `PublicSignalsBuilder` as a
downstream client — exporting before §2.5 lands would ship an interface about to change. It is also
the only item in a repo we do not own.

**One-way:** our title/notary machinery must NOT move there. Their `provinceId` ("assigned by CSCA
at registration") has no passport equivalent and needs its own home regardless.

## 3. Parallel work — not blocked

- 🔴🔴 **THE ANONYMITY SET IS THE REAL LIMIT, AND THE WALLET NEVER TELLS THE USER ITS SIZE
  (2026-08-02). This is the most dangerous gap in the privacy story, because it is a FALSE ASSURANCE
  rather than a missing feature.**

  Splitting, stealth addresses and ZK proofs all protect the same thing: WHICH deposit a withdrawal
  came from. **None of them help if there are few deposits to hide among.** At launch the set is
  approximately one, and the guarantee is approximately zero - while the UI says "private".

  **TIMING MAKES IT WORSE, and the current design maximises the signal.** `submitDeposits` fires N
  transactions back-to-back from ONE address. In a quiet pool that streak is unmistakably one
  person's split: an observer reads the count, the denominations and the total. Two users happening
  to deposit simultaneously is exactly what early volume does NOT provide. (Note the address is
  shared across the streak anyway - so batching into `depositBatch` costs nothing here. The leak is
  the STREAK'S EXISTENCE and its shape, not its transaction count.)

  **WHAT MUST BE BUILT - and it is a UX obligation, not a nicety:**
  1. **Compute and SHOW the current anonymity set** - deposits sharing each denomination, at deposit
     time and again at withdrawal time. The pool's own state has this; nothing new is needed to
     measure it.
  2. **Refuse, or warn hard, below a threshold.** A wallet that accepts a deposit into a set of 3
     while presenting a privacy UI is lying to its user. Match `allowRemainder: false`'s posture -
     raise rather than silently do the unsafe thing.
  3. **~~Decorrelate deposit timing with randomised delays~~ - WRONG, AND THE "TENSION" WITH ONE-CLICK
     UX WAS INVENTED (corrected 2026-08-02).** Privacy Pools deposits are **public by design**: the
     deposit is always visible and always tied to the depositor's address. A streak therefore reveals
     nothing the individual deposits do not already reveal, and delaying them buys nothing while
     making the wallet unusable (see the 99-note case). **`depositBatch` and one-click UX cost no
     privacy - build them.** The leak that matters is on the WITHDRAWAL side: whether a withdrawal
     can be tied back to a specific deposit, which is governed by the ANONYMITY SET and by AMOUNT
     matching, neither of which deposit timing touches. Spend the effort on withdrawal-side
     denomination discipline and on surfacing set size, not on delays.
  4. **Say what is NOT protected**: amount and timing correlation survive everything above. The repo
     already concedes the multiset leaks; the USER has never been told.

  **⚠️ CORRECTION (2026-08-02): my claim that the concept is absent from the wallet was a
  LITERAL-STRING ARTIFACT.** I grepped for "anonymity" and reported zero. Searching the CONCEPT finds
  it reasoned about explicitly in `src/pp/deposit.ts:35-38`: *"two users depositing the same total in
  the same unit are indistinguishable... `Mixed` would emit 9 + 9x0.1, a shape few others will
  share."* The thinking is present and correct. What is genuinely missing is only that it is never
  SHOWN to the user - a code comment is not a disclosure. **This is the second time this session that
  a single-keyword grep produced a false "absent" claim; search the concept, not the word.**

  **✅ THE ECDSA SOUNDNESS HOLE IS CLOSED (2026-08-02). 77/77, mutation-verified.**

  `ScalarField::from_bignum` now constrains the unconstrained `get_wnaf_slices2` hint. Two things
  had to be got right, and the first attempt got both wrong:

  **1. The identity, rearranged so no digit is signed.** wNAF digits are `2*s - 15`, i.e. -15..15,
  and BigNum cannot hold negatives - which is exactly why upstream left `From<Field>`'s `N >= 64`
  branch commented out. Rearranging removes the sign entirely:
  `sum_i (2*s_i - 15)*16^(N-1-i) = 2*S - (16^N - 1)` with `S = sum_i s_i*16^(N-1-i)`,
  so the check is **`x + skew + (16^N - 1) == 2*S`** - both sides non-negative.

  **2. ALL N slices.** `into_bignum` consumes one FEWER than `SCALAR_SLICES` for secp256r1 (64 vs 65)
  and secp384r1 (96 vs 97), matching only for secp521r1 - which is why asserting that round-trip
  failed exactly 7 tests. The reconstruction here walks all N.

  Plus a **range check on every slice**: `base4_slices` is `[u8; N]`, so 16..255 was admissible into
  a 4-bit point table - a second, independent way to lie, unaddressed by the sum identity alone.

  **Implementation notes for anyone touching it:** digits go in via `set_limb(0, ..)`, not repeated
  addition - Noir rejects a runtime-valued loop bound ("Could not determine loop bound at
  compile-time"), which is how the second attempt failed.

  **VERIFIED, not assumed:** 77/77 `noir_dl_lib` tests including all 8 ECDSA vectors (nargo exit 0,
  read from the recorded `NARGO_EXIT=` line, not a harness summary). **Mutation-verified:** flipping
  `16^N - 1` to `16^N + 1` fires `Assertion failed: wNAF slices do not decode to the scalar`, so the
  constraint is live rather than vacuous.

  **The lesson stands even though the bug is fixed:** I ported this library, deleted a module from
  it, bumped its dependencies and ran its tests WITHOUT READING IT. No transcript scan could have
  found this - the vendor's own `// TODO: NONE OF THIS IS CONSTRAINED YET. FIX!` was sitting in the
  file the whole time. Vendored code needs reading, not just building.

  **⚠️ UPGRADEABILITY IS ITSELF A CENSORSHIP LEVER, AND THAT WAS SAID ONCE IN PASSING AND NEVER
  BOOKED (recovered 2026-08-02).** `IdentityRegistry` is UUPS-upgradeable, so **an upgrade could
  un-register people and block their withdrawals** - the same shape as the ASP-root lever in the
  decisions above, but reachable by the upgrade key rather than the postman. `Entrypoint` is
  UUPSUpgradeable too, and its storage-layout note is now live because a deployment path exists
  (see the DeployLib entry). **Nothing in the no-retroactive-lever story accounts for the upgrade
  key.** Whatever is decided for the authority set (decision 2) should be decided for this at the
  same time, or the answer is inconsistent by construction.

  **🙋 DECISIONS FLAGGED FOR YOU AND NEVER COLLECTED (recovered 2026-08-02 by scanning the
  transcript for places I refused to guess).** Each was raised mid-work, answered "that is your
  call", and then left in conversation. The topics are discussed elsewhere in this file; **the
  pending DECISION was recorded nowhere**, which is how a flagged choice becomes a forgotten one.

  1. **ASP root set: monotonic/append-only, or removable?** Replacing the equality check with
     `mapping(root => publishedAt)` + an O(1) lookup makes the set append-only: once admitted, never
     removable - **including a root later found genuinely tainted.** That is a governance call, not
     an engineering one, and it weakens the provable-dissociation story `COMPLIANCE-THESIS.md`
     leans on. **Until this or one of its alternatives is built, "this fork has no retroactive
     third-party lever" is FALSE** - say so rather than repeating the claim.

  2. **Authority set: immutable, governance-gated, or owner-mutable?** Immutable is what makes the
     no-lever claim true; owner-mutable is the current lever with extra steps. The blocker is not
     technical: it is whether compliance may REQUIRE adding an authority post-deploy, which I cannot
     determine. It is constructor-shaped, so it is cheap now and expensive later.

  3. **OFAC predicate: is the auditability loss acceptable, and how does `s` reach the authority?**
     The `holderRoot -> person` linkage does not exist on-chain at all, so the predicate is not
     currently expressible in-circuit. Encrypted to a published authority key is the obvious shape,
     but the trade is a policy call. Relates to the sanctions anchor (`backend/cre/sanctions_lists`, task 28 — the anchoring half,
     now built and tested; **note it can prove a listing but never a DELISTING**, since all three
     declared lists express removal by absence).

  4. **Does `title_holder` need the ZK proving fix?** Applied to `withdraw_identity` regardless; it
     proves title rather than a spend, so it may not need it. Cheap to decide, silent if wrong.

  **RESOLVED while flagged, recorded so nobody re-opens it:** `quidmints/rarime-rn-sdk` **PR #1 was
  MERGED 2026-07-27** (expo-file-system 57 File/Directory API). The wallet's
  `github:quidmints/rarime-rn-sdk#main` dependency therefore resolves to the fixed code. **This is
  NOT the reason `prove.ts` cannot be unit-tested** - that is expo-file-system shipping untranspiled
  TypeScript inside `node_modules`, which is unrelated and still true.

  **🚫 "refs=0" CANNOT PROVE A VERIFIER IS DEAD - AND I ALMOST DELETED 35 CONTRACTS ON IT (2026-08-02).**

  I measured **0 of 35** `PPerPassport_*Verifier2.sol` referenced by any contract or test and called
  them dead weight. Then the control: **the Noir verifiers score 0 of 76.** Identical. So the metric
  distinguishes nothing.

  **WHY:** verifiers are wired by ADDRESS at deploy time, never referenced by symbol in Solidity - so
  EVERY verifier in this repo reads as unreferenced, live ones included. This is downstream of the
  gap already recorded here: there is no deployment/wiring layer. **A name grep can never answer
  "is this verifier used".** Check deploy config and address references, never symbols.

  **REGENERATION, NOT DELETION, IS THE DEFAULT ASSUMPTION** for the Groth16 verifiers. Task 36 was
  rewritten with the correction at the top; do not act on its original claim if it is cached anywhere.

  **AND A PRIOR QUESTION NOBODY HAS ASKED: 35 vs 76 IS NOT A MIGRATION RATIO.** If
  `PPerPassport_*Verifier2` and `NoirRegisterIdentity_*` were the same circuits in two proof systems
  the counts would correspond. They do not, and the naming differs structurally - they may be
  DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS (per-passport query verification vs identity registration) rather than
  old-and-new of one thing. **Settle that before anything else; everything downstream depends on it.**

  **WHAT "100% NOIR" ACTUALLY NEEDS** (the source migration IS done - zero `.circom` files remain):
  1. the 6 orphan profiles get Noir twins (task 10; 29 of 35 already have one)
  2. every still-needed Groth16 verifier gets a REGENERATED Noir equivalent
  3. a deployment layer that wires verifiers BY ADDRESS - `DeployLib` now deploys pools, but
     verifier/registry wiring is still absent, which is *why* everything looks unreferenced
  4. retire only what is provably superseded, verified against deploy config

  **THE PATTERN, third occurrence this session:** `RootValidity` "untested", the bisect "superseded",
  and now this. Each time I had a plausible explanation for an absent result and reached for it
  instead of testing whether the MEASUREMENT could distinguish the two cases. **The test here was one
  command: check whether the thing I claimed was alive also scored zero.** When a grep returns
  nothing, run the control before drawing the conclusion.

  **📋 FULL INCOMPLETENESS SCAN COMPLETED (2026-08-02) - all 102 passages, not a sample.**
  Scanned every assistant message in the thread for statements of incompleteness (a different
  vocabulary from the earlier trap/silent/fragile scans, aimed at "I did not / still needs / left
  open / partially"). **Three findings were unbooked and are now tasks 33, 34, 35.** The rest were
  honest caveats attached to work that did complete, and are already covered by the entries below.

  **The pattern worth keeping:** all three had been WRITTEN DOWN in prose - the stables leg and the
  vendored copies appear in this file, the token in a session summary - and none had been lifted into
  a task. **Recorded somewhere, actionable nowhere.** That is the same failure as the bisect result:
  the information existed and no one was going to act on it. When a finding is stated in a reply,
  lift it to a task in the same turn or it does not exist.

  **Deliberate non-checks, recorded so they are not mistaken for oversights:** the Iranian registry
  endpoint (not checked, deliberately); whether Chainlink's confidential HTTP hides the request from
  node operators (undeterminable from the docs); the licence of one upstream dependency. Each needs
  one external look, none is blocking.

  **🧭 COLD-START BRIEFING (2026-08-02). Read this before touching circuits or artifacts.**
  **Upstream provenance and every change we made to upstream code now live in `README.md`** - which
  file came from Privacy Pools, which from rarimo, which is ours, and the reproducing command. The
  short version: **51 non-generated contracts, 58 files in `noir_dl_lib`, 3 rarimo circuit files and
  62 wallet files have changed since the squashed fork import `0762975`. We are a heavily modified
  fork, not a thin skin - do not assume any upstream file is untouched.**

  **TRAPS - these bite silently:**
  - **The toolchain is a locally patched compiler that exists on ONE machine**
    (`1.0.0-beta.26+quid-icefix1`). CI and other developers WILL fail the guard, correctly. The
    circuits still build on stock beta.26; the `BigNumParams` accommodation was kept so they do.
    Stock binary at `~/.nargo/bin/nargo.beta26-release.bak`.
  - **`bb` must be on PATH** (`export PATH="$HOME/.bb:$PATH"`) or codegen reports it missing.
  - **`codegen-verifiers.sh` is step 4 of 5**; step 5 is `tools/prove-escrow-fixtures.sh`, for the
    numbered `escrow_envelope0/1/2` fixtures `IdentityRegistry.t.sol` loads. Skipping it yields
    `SumcheckFailed()` far from the cause - I skipped it once and broke 18 tests.
  - **`aggregate_withdrawals` and the 76 `NoirRegisterIdentity_*.sol` are NOT in codegen TARGETS.**
    Changing those circuits refreshes no verifier, and the mismatch surfaces nowhere near the cause.
  - ~~**Nothing constructs a pool in production.**~~ ✅ **FIXED 2026-08-02.** `DeployLib` now has
    `deploySimplePool` / `deployComplexPool`, both taking `_aggregationVerifier`, both deterministic
    via the salts that previously decorated the file. `test/pool/DeployPool.t.sol` exercises the path
    (6 tests): the verifier is carried onto a deployed pool, batching is REACHABLE on it (reaching
    `EmptyBatch` proves execution passed the configuration guard), zero is still a legitimate
    non-batching deployment, `PrivacyPoolComplex` is deployed for the first time by anything, and the
    salts genuinely bind both address and deployer.
    **⚠️ THIS INVALIDATES A PREMISE ELSEWHERE:** the note that `Entrypoint`'s storage-layout change is
    "harmless now (nothing deployed)" was true only while no deployment path existed. `Entrypoint` IS
    `UUPSUpgradeable`. Re-read that entry before deploying anything.
  - **Regenerate only what changed.** Re-proving unchanged circuits is churn (ZK proofs are
    non-deterministic). `title_holder` used to FAIL when re-proved; that was task 30 and it is fixed -
    the codegen no longer overwrites a committed witness. Churn is now the only reason to be selective.

  **FALSE SUCCESSES that nearly fooled me, recorded so they do not fool the next run:**
  - **A background-task notification's "exit code 0" is the WRAPPER's exit, not the command's.** A
    `cargo test` that aborted with exit 101 was reported as "completed (exit code 0)". Read the
    recorded `EXIT=`/`CARGO_EXIT=` line in the log, never the harness summary.
  - **`noirc_frontend`'s suite needs `RUST_MIN_STACK=134217728` on macOS**, or
    `deeply_nested_terms` overflows the stack in release and aborts the run, hiding everything after.
  - **A green wallet test file proves nothing if the module cannot load** - six `pp/` modules were
    unloadable by `node --test`, which is why that directory had zero tests for so long.
  - **`grep -c` and `\b` failed silently here**, producing a bogus dropped-test list. Verify an
    empty result before believing it. **And the inverse trap, which cost more:** I dismissed a REAL
    finding (`RootValidity` untested) as a tooling artifact because two suites were NAMED after it.
    **A dismissal is a conclusion.** Re-run the audit properly instead of explaining it away.

  **VEINS OF WORK NOTICED BUT NOT STARTED** (recorded so they are not lost with the context):
  - ~~**`PrivacyPoolComplex` is never deployed anywhere**~~ - ✅ deployable as of 2026-08-02 via
    `DeployLib.deployComplexPool`, covered by `DeployPool.t.sol`. It is still not deployed by any
    OPERATIONAL script (there is no `script/` dir), so task 22 remains a guard rather than a repair -
    but the path exists and is tested.
  - **`IdentityRegistry.t.sol` WRITES `identity_witness.json`** (`vm.writeJson`) that other tests
    consume - an ordering dependency nothing enforces.
  - **`escrow_documents.json` is a pipeline input with no regeneration guard**; if the registration
    tree and the proofs disagree about the root, the symptom is `SumcheckFailed()`.
  - **`MockEntrypoint` lives inside `PrivacyPoolSimple.t.sol`**, so new suites import from a test file.
  - **The wallet's bundled `assets/circuits/*.circuit`** are refreshed by codegen, but nothing
    checks they match the deployed verifiers.
  - **`title_holder` looks worse in a coverage count than it is** - 0 in-circuit tests, but covered
    from outside by `pp::title_holder::test_matches_wallet_derivation` and a Solidity verifier suite.

  **IF YOU DO ONE THING NEXT:** ~~task **24**~~ - **RE-SCOPED AND PARTLY DONE 2026-08-02.** It was
  recorded as "83 passport verifiers generated on beta.13, in no regeneration script". **There are
  76** (counted; this file said 83 here and 76 below), **they cannot be regenerated in this repo at
  all**, and **nothing references them** - see GAP 1's successor below. ~~task **28**~~ — **DONE 2026-08-02**: the
  sanctions workflow is rewritten multi-jurisdiction, tested, and cross-checked against the contract
  (GAP 1 below). It was worse than "untested" — unsorted leaves meant every publish would have
  reverted, so nothing it produced could ever have been anchored.

  **TASK 24 IS NOW UNBLOCKED.** It was gated on the unexplained `title_holder` `SumcheckFailed()`,
  which any re-prove would have hit; that was task 30, root-caused and fixed 2026-08-02 (see below).
  Regenerating verifiers no longer destroys the witness it regenerates from.

  **✅ TASK 30 SOLVED 2026-08-02. It was not the vk, and it was not the toolchain.** The question was
  why re-proving `title_holder` produced a proof its own BYTE-IDENTICAL verifier rejected with
  `SumcheckFailed()`, with the same VK and a passing native `bb verify`. Both hypotheses recorded
  here - "proves against a key other than the one it wrote", "the fixture step differs for that
  target" - were wrong. **Nothing was corrupt; the proof was of a DIFFERENT STATEMENT.**

  `nargo` reads `Prover.toml`, so both loops in `codegen-verifiers.sh` did `cp <witness> Prover.toml`
  before executing. **`Prover.toml` is a COMMITTED INPUT** for any circuit whose baseline is not named
  `Prover.baseline.toml`, and `title_holder` is one - so generating its SECOND fixture permanently
  replaced the baseline witness, and the replacement was committed in `db1df14`. Every run afterwards
  proved the baseline fixture from the id1 witness.

  **WHY EVERY SIGNAL SAID FINE:** `bb prove` succeeded, `bb verify` accepted (the proof is valid),
  the vk was unchanged, the verifier byte-identical. Only Solidity rejected it, because
  `TitleHolderHonkVerifier.t.sol` HARDCODES the two public inputs and they belong to the real
  baseline. **A proof of the wrong statement is indistinguishable from a proof of the right one until
  something pins the statement** - and only the on-chain test does.

  Reproduced both directions before fixing: the committed witness yields the id1 public inputs and
  `[FAIL: SumcheckFailed()]`; the pre-`db1df14` witness yields the baseline's and 3/3 pass with a
  freshly generated proof.

  **FIXED AT THE CAUSE:** one `execute_witness` helper saves `Prover.toml`, runs nargo, restores it,
  *verifies* the restore, and restores on failure too. **Re-proving `title_holder` is now safe**, so
  the "regenerate only what changed" warning above stands on churn alone, not on this.

  **⚠️ DO NOT "SIMPLIFY" IT TO `nargo execute -p <name>`.** That is the obvious fix and it is worse:
  nargo splits the extension at the FIRST dot, so `-p Prover.titleid1` resolves to `Prover.toml` and
  the argument is **discarded silently** - `-p Prover.doesnotexist` exits 0 and solves `Prover.toml`.
  Measured: with `Prover.toml` absent it errors naming `Prover.toml`, and a dotless name reads
  correctly. Every witness here is `Prover.<what>.toml`, across six files including two generators.

  **🔍 BACKEND COVERAGE AUDIT (2026-08-02). Frontend excluded - on-device puppeteer, later.**

  **✅ SOLIDITY: no gaps NOW - but the first audit was right and my "correction" was wrong.**
  `RootValidity.sol` really was uncovered. I dismissed it as a broken-`\b` false positive because
  two suites are NAMED after it - `RootValidityCopies` and `PoseidonSMTRootValidity` - but NEITHER
  IMPORTS IT. They drive the three consumers and assert through them, so the rule was covered only
  as far as those consumers exercise it, and a fourth consumer adopting it wrongly would have been
  caught by nothing. **A dismissal is a conclusion and needs checking like any other.**
  Closed by `test/state/RootValidityLib.t.sol` (7 tests, mutation-verified twice: dropping
  `recordedAt_ != 0` - the original three-copy defect - and making the boundary inclusive both fail).
  430 forge tests pass.

  **✅ GAP 1 CLOSED 2026-08-02 (task 28) - and "untested" was the smaller half of it.**
  `backend/cre/ofac_sdn` → **`backend/cre/sanctions_lists`**. The logic moved to an untagged
  `sources.go` (the sibling's split, same reason), `main.go` keeps the CRE runtime, **28 Go tests**
  now run on the host, and a Forge pair publishes the Go builder's real output through
  `RegistrySourceAnchor`. **438 forge / 28 go, one run.**

  **IT COULD NEVER HAVE PUBLISHED ANYTHING.** It sorted its ENTRIES by uid and then mapped them to
  leaf HASHES, which are in no order at all, while `_computeRoot` reverts `LeavesNotStrictlySorted`
  on anything but strict ascent. **Every `onReport` would have reverted.** Zero tests is how that
  survived being written and marked "compiling" - the workflow was not untested code that worked, it
  was code that had never once been run against the thing it talks to. Its leaf was also
  re-splittable (`uid + "|" + name`), the defect sec. 2.18ao fixed in the sibling.

  **MULTI-JURISDICTION, BECAUSE ONE COUNTRY'S SHAPE IS NOT THE SHAPE (user, 2026-08-02: "it has to
  work with the UK, the USA, and other countries").** Three real lists are declared - US OFAC SDN,
  UK OFSI consolidated, UN Security Council - one per deployment, each with its own `registryId`.
  Every field was read off the actual export, and they disagree on everything that matters:
  - **what a ROW is.** OFSI publishes one row PER ALIAS: 19,761 rows carry 5,135 designations. A
    design keyed on "reference identifies a row" - which the US export happens to satisfy - collapses
    three quarters of the UK list. Only 13,865 rows are distinct once decoded, so **dedup is
    load-bearing, not a precaution**.
  - **where the KIND lives** - an OFAC field, a differently-named OFSI field, or (UN) the CONTAINER
    the row sits in, with nothing on the row saying so.
  - **whether the file declares its own length.** Only OFAC does; it is now cross-checked, and it is
    the strongest anti-rot guard available anywhere in this workflow.

  **ONE ROW IN 19,761 DECIDED THE UK KEY, AND THAT IS THE ARGUMENT FOR FETCHING THE FILE.** The
  obvious choice is `UKSanctionsListRef`, the citable one. It is **EMPTY** for Alexander SAMOFAL,
  designated 2023-04-21 under Global Human Rights - so keying on it makes him unanchorable and takes
  the whole UK snapshot down with him. `GroupID` is never empty and partitions identically (5,135
  either way). **Both fields look equally good in any fixture small enough to read.**

  **THE CROSS-LANGUAGE FIXTURE WAS WORTHLESS AND ONLY MUTATION SHOWED IT.** Four designations:
  ascending leaves make the sorted-pair rule a no-op at level one, a power-of-two count never
  produces an odd level so nothing is promoted, and the last pair happened to be ordered. **Deleting
  the pair sorting from the Go builder left the Forge test green.** Now seven designations, and the
  generator REFUSES to write a fixture whose tree fails to exercise both rules. Re-verified: each
  mutation passes in Go and fails in Solidity.

  **WHAT IT STILL CANNOT DO, recorded so nobody assumes otherwise:** all three lists are
  `membershipMeansListed`, so **delisting is an ABSENCE claim and a keccak root cannot prove it**
  (sec. 2.18bp). An attester built on this can revoke on a hit and can never reinstate on a removal.
  All three are also `authenticityTransportOnly` - nothing is signed by the authority, so **the
  postman cannot be removed for any of them** (sec. 2.18bv). Both are properties of what the
  authorities publish, now declared per source rather than discovered later.

  **✅ GAP 2 RE-EXAMINED AND PARTLY CLOSED 2026-08-03 - the framing was misleading, like title_holder's.**
  The two `query_identity` crates are WRAPPERS; the selector logic they wrap is tested where it lives,
  in `noir_dl_lib/src/query.nr` (14 tests, including `test_an_empty_selector_discloses_nothing`,
  `test_bit_0_alone_reveals_the_nullifier_and_nothing_else`, `test_the_nullifier_is_zero_for_everyone_when_its_bit_is_clear`,
  `test_asking_about_citizenship_no_longer_discloses_the_personal_number`). Counting `#[test]` per
  CRATE said zero; counting coverage says otherwise. **A third instance of the same measurement error.**

  **WHAT GENUINELY HAD NO COVERAGE WAS THE SEAM**, and no same-language test could reach it: the
  circuit returns 23 public signals whose ORDER is a tuple literal in `main.nr`, while
  `sdk/lib/PublicSignalsBuilder.sol` writes each one at a HARDCODED assembly offset
  (`mstore(add(dataPointer_, 416), selector_)` = index 12). Neither side can see the other. Transpose
  two entries and everything compiles, every Noir test passes, every Forge test passes - and the
  verifier reads `timestampUpperbound` out of the slot holding `timestampLowerbound`. **The proof
  still verifies; it just means something else.** Same class as the LeanIMT sibling ordering and the
  relay `context` pin.
  **Closed by `tools/check-query-public-signals.py`** - compares the circuit's tuple against the
  ASSEMBLY OFFSETS (not the doc comments; the offsets are what runs), covering the 14 signals the
  wrapper names for itself. **Mutation-verified**: swapping the two timestamp bounds is caught at
  both indices. Two spelling differences (`identity_count_*` vs `identityCounter*`) are recorded as
  reviewed aliases rather than by loosening the comparison.
  **Still open in this area:** the first 9 signals come from the library's return tuple and are not
  named in the wrapper, so they are not covered by this check.

  **🟠 GAP 2 (original) - four circuits declare ZERO `#[test]`:** `query_identity`, `query_identity_td1`,
  `register_identity_light_td1`, `title_holder`. Counts elsewhere: pp 85, noir_dl_lib 74,
  escrow_envelope 4, aggregate_withdrawals 3, register_identity_td1 2, notary_action 2,
  withdraw_identity 2, register_identity 1, ragequit 1. **`title_holder` is partly covered from
  outside** (`pp::title_holder::test_matches_wallet_derivation`, plus a Solidity verifier suite), so
  the sharpest gaps are the two `query_identity` variants - the selector logic that decides what a
  passport proof reveals. Task 29.

  **✅ AGGREGATION: the entrypoint is now reachable and its guards are tested** - see the
  AGGREGATION_VERIFIER fix. Still NOT finished: the happy path needs a real N=16 proof (~27 GB), and
  double-spend across a batch is now COVERED (both within-batch and across-batches), and the
  settlement loop runs end-to-end against a doubled verifier. The remaining gap is the real
  cryptography: a genuine N=16 proof (~27 GB).

  **⚙️ TOOLCHAIN / CIRCUITS — full record in `backend/circuits/NOIR-DL-PORT.md` (2026-08-02).**

  **✅ ALL 13 CIRCUIT CRATES NOW COMPILE ON beta.26, no ICE.** The six that could not
  (register_identity{,_td1,_light_td1}, query_identity{,_td1}, escrow_envelope) were blocked by an
  ICE in `noir_dl_lib`. noir_dl_lib 77/77, pp 87/87, escrow_envelope 4/4, withdraw_identity 5/5,
  notary_action 5/5, ragequit 3/3. `verify-migration.sh`: **no coverage lost**.
  Roster went 80 -> 77 for ONE reason, recorded inline in MIGRATION-BASELINE.txt: the three
  `sigver::curve_384::*` tests went with the dead file they tested.

  **🔴 THE FINISH LINE IS THE VERIFIERS — and the reasoning below is right while its conclusion is
  not executable (corrected 2026-08-02).** A verifier is generated from a circuit's VK; the VK
  follows the constraint system; the constraint system follows the compiler and the library source.
  These crates could not build on beta.26 AT ALL before, so every committed
  `contracts/passport/verifiers2/noir/NoirRegisterIdentity_*.sol` came from beta.13, and a stale
  verifier rejects valid proofs on-chain. All true.

  **BUT THE 76 CANNOT BE REGENERATED IN THIS REPO, so "regenerating them" was never a task anyone
  could do.** They are rarimo's, built from 76 PARAMETERISED PROFILES that do not exist here — we
  have three `register_identity` crates with hardcoded globals and no profile generator. They
  arrived in the fork import `0762975` and `git diff 0762975..HEAD` over that directory is EMPTY.
  **And nothing references them**: no contract, test or script names one, only docs. The live path
  takes `HolderRegistration.icaoRegistrationVerifier` as a deployed ADDRESS, so the repo had 76
  verifiers it cannot use and none it can.

  **⚠️ THREE OF THE REGENERATED SET ARE BLOCKED ON RAM, and they are parked beside the N=16
  aggregation blocker** in "THE SECOND JOB FOR THE SAME BIG BOX" (sec. 2.4pre) - the only two pieces
  of work here waiting on a bigger machine. 72 of 75 passport verifiers are regenerated; the three
  exceptions keep their stale beta.1 verifiers and block nothing the others cover.

  **✅ ONE THAT WE CAN NOW EXISTS**: `passport/verifiers/RegisterIdentityLightHonkVerifier.sol`,
  generated on the patched beta.26, in codegen TARGETS, and tested against a REAL proof on-chain
  (3 tests, 2.46M gas, every public input tampered in turn). `register_identity_light_td1` is the
  only identity circuit with a committed witness, hence the only one whose verifier can be proven
  rather than merely emitted. **The other four — including `register_identity_td1`, which the ICAO
  path needs — are blocked on a real document (task 6), not on the toolchain.** Emitting them
  untested would add four more unusable verifiers to a repo already holding 76.

  **CORRECTION (user, 2026-08-02): "they are not dead weight, they need to be regenerated."
  Right on both counts, and my framing was wrong.** They are the deployable verifiers for real-world
  passport profiles - what lets an actual traveller's proof be accepted. Nothing references them
  *in this repo* only because verifiers are wired by DEPLOYED ADDRESS, which is a wiring fact, not a
  verdict on their value. And they do need regenerating: the VK follows the compiler, so beta.13
  verifiers reject proofs from our beta.26 toolchain - silently, at deploy time.

  **BUT REGENERATION IS BLOCKED ON DOCUMENTS, NOT ON EFFORT - verified upstream 2026-08-02:**
  - The generator EXISTS (I said it did not; wrong): `register_identity/js/autogen.sh` +
    `process_passport.js` in `rarimo/passport-zk-circuits-noir`. It writes `src/main.nr` with the 14
    generic arguments and takes the circuit NAME from that file's first line.
  - **The parameters are DER byte lengths of a REAL DOCUMENT**: `compile_params` is
    `{dg1_len: dg1_bytes.length, dg15_len: dg15_bytes.length, ec_len: ec_bytes.length,
    sa_len: sa_bytes.length, n, ec_field_size: <from the key's ASN.1 params>, ...}`.
  - **The names are LOSSY and cannot be inverted.** The naming expression is
    `sig_type _ dg_hash_type*8 _ (dg1==93?3:1) _ ceil((ec_len+8)/64) _ ec_shift*8 _ dg1_shift*8 _ ...`
    so `ec_len`/`dg15_len` survive only as 64-byte BUCKETS, and `sa_len`, `n`, `ec_field_size` and
    `hash_type` do not appear at all.
  - **No parameter table exists anywhere reachable**: not in either rarimo repo, not in our tree, not
    in the wallet (which ships only our five `.circuit` files). Upstream's `test/inputs/passport` and
    `test/inputs/generated` are EMPTY placeholders reading *"Here inputs will appear"* - real passport
    data is not published, correctly.

  **SO THE UNBLOCK IS AN INPUT, AND THERE ARE THREE WAYS TO GET IT:** (a) ask rarimo for the 76
  parameter tuples - they generated them and must hold them, which makes this one request rather than
  an engineering programme; (b) regenerate each profile as a real document of that profile is
  scanned, folding into task 6/15; (c) use document dumps we already hold, if any.

  **THE PIPELINE ITSELF IS PROVEN AND WAITING** - `RegisterIdentityLightHonkVerifier` was generated
  and tested on-chain by exactly this route on 2026-08-02, so profile regeneration is a table away,
  not a build away.

  **✅ UNBLOCKED: `bb` was installed ALL ALONG** at `~/.bb/bb`, off PATH and at **v0.82.2**, which is
  why it read as absent. "Not installed" was wrong. **Now upgraded to 5.1.0** (bbup), so
  nargo beta.26 + bb 5.1.0 finally match what `codegen-verifiers.sh` enforces.
  **Put `~/.bb` on PATH** or the script still reports it missing.

  **🧬 THE ORPHANS ARE INHERITED, AND WE SHOULD STOP INHERITING THEM.**
  `noir_dl_lib/src/bignum/` is a vendored copy of `noir-lang/noir-bignum` and `big_curve/` of
  `noir_bigcurve`; upstream ships every field ITS users might want, so nine `fields/*` modules
  (`U256`..`U8192`, `ed25519Fr`) are unreferenced generality that arrived with the library, not
  orphans of our design. **Prune to what we use** (task 25) - the standing rule is no dead code.
  `curve_384.nr` was a different case and is already deleted: a SECOND, never-wired Brainpool P384R1
  under a secp384r1 name. Nothing was lost - `sigver::ecdsa::verify_brainpoolp384r1_ecdsa` is live at
  `not_passports_zk_circuits.nr:549`.

  **🔗 THE SYNC PATH IS BROKEN AND SHOULD BE REPAIRED, NOT ACCEPTED.** rarimo's
  `passport-zk-circuits-noir` was last touched 2025-11-18 and never made this port, so we have
  silently become the fork with no route back. Decide and record which: (a) push the beta.26 port
  upstream so both sides converge, (b) declare a hard fork and prune aggressively since sync is not
  coming, or (c) pin a vendor commit + changelog so the divergence is at least legible. **Today it
  is (b) by accident, which is the worst of the three.** Task 27.

  **✅ THE ICE IS FILED UPSTREAM: noir-lang/noir#13440** (2026-08-02), with the 14-line reproduction,
  the narrowing table and the 3-hunk patch. Still UNFIXED upstream, so `backend/circuits/noir-ice-repro/` is a 14-line
  dependency-free reproduction; beta.26 is the newest release and still has it. Our source carries an
  ACCOMMODATION (22 `global ... = BigNumParams::new(..)` -> `pub fn`), semantics-preserving and
  **measured at ZERO gate cost** (1 ACIR opcode, identical to an empty circuit - the constants still
  fold). **Revert it when upstream is fixed.** Task 26.

  **❌ THE RARIMO SIDE IS *NOT* IN ALIGNMENT (measured 2026-08-02). Correcting an earlier entry.**

  **The toolchain PIN is aligned:** `codegen-verifiers.sh` enforces nargo 1.0.0-beta.26 / bb 5.1.0,
  and installed nargo IS beta.26. **`bb` is not on PATH on this machine at all**, so verifier codegen
  cannot be run here regardless.

  **But six crates ICE on plain `nargo compile`:** register_identity, register_identity_td1,
  register_identity_light_td1, query_identity, query_identity_td1, **escrow_envelope** —
  `ice: all function ids should have metadata`.
  **THIS CORRECTS WHAT I BANKED BEFORE**, which said the passport crates "compile on beta.26, only
  `nargo test` crashes". That is wrong: they do not compile. Compiling fine: pp, noir_dl_lib,
  withdraw_identity, aggregate_withdrawals, notary_action, title_holder, ragequit — **so the PP
  withdrawal path is aligned and the passport/identity ENROLMENT path is not.** `escrow_envelope`
  being in the broken set matters most: it is ours, not rarimo's, and it is how a revocation secret
  gets registered before anyone can withdraw.

  **ROOT CAUSE NARROWED TO `noir_dl_lib` ITSELF, with a 3-second reproduction.** A crate that merely
  DECLARES `noir_dl` as a dependency and uses nothing from it ICEs. The failing crates are exactly
  those depending on it; every passing crate does not. Minimal trigger inside the lib is
  **`bignum` + `sigver` together** — neither compiles alone (unresolved siblings), and dropping any
  single submodule of either still ICEs. Earlier module-deletion bisection failed because it was run
  in TEST mode; the repro above is compile-mode and cheap, so this is now tractable.

  **A SECOND, SEPARATE MISALIGNMENT: `noir_dl_lib` and `escrow_envelope` still pin poseidon v0.2.0**
  while the migrated crates use v0.3.0 — and v0.2.0 is itself beta.26-incompatible
  (`error: Comptime global RATE used in non-comptime code`, poseidon2.nr:22). **Bumping it to v0.3.0
  does NOT fix the ICE**, so these are two independent problems and fixing the pin is necessary but
  not sufficient. (This is the "why are we still saying poseidon v0.2.0" question, answered: because
  noir_dl_lib really does still use it.)

  **✅ THE ERC-20 FIRST-SPEND DEAD END, CLOSED WITHOUT A CONTRACT CHANGE (`withdrawPlan.ts`, 12
  tests).** I had proposed ERC-4337 + paymaster. Checking the mechanism first made that the wrong
  size of fix: `Entrypoint.relay` ALREADY takes its fee in the withdrawn asset, and the only missing
  piece is gas AT the fresh address. So when the user also holds a note in the NATIVE pool, both
  withdrawals are sent to THE SAME derived address - the token arrives with ETH beside it.
  **The privacy cost is zero**: the two legs are linked to each other, but that link exists anyway
  the moment the tokens are spent from that address, and neither is linked to the depositor because
  both emerge from pools.
  **With no native note it REFUSES by default.** A wallet that silently withdraws tokens to an
  address that can never move them has handed the user a permanent loss dressed as a privacy win.
  **RESIDUAL, AND IT IS THE ONLY CASE 4337 IS STILL FOR:** a user holding ONLY tokens and no ETH
  anywhere. A paymaster taking its fee in the withdrawn token removes the need for ETH entirely.

  **⚠️ CORRECTION TO WHAT I BANKED EARLIER.** I wrote "PrivacyPoolComplex exists, so this is real".
  It exists as CODE and is never deployed - its salt is declared in DeployLib and never used, there
  are no deployment scripts, and nothing instantiates it. `Entrypoint` supports any asset, so the
  dead end is real the day an ERC-20 pool is registered, but **it is not a live break today**. This
  is a guard placed before the failure, not a repair after it.

  **✅ THE WITHDRAWAL PATH IS JOINED (`withdrawFlow.ts`, 12 tests).** Everything underneath was
  tested and pinned but nothing composed it, so no screen could drive a withdrawal.
  **NOTE SELECTION IS A PRIVACY DECISION, not bookkeeping.** The circuit spends ONE note and returns
  the remainder as change, so the smallest covering note is chosen: spending a large note for a small
  withdrawal leaves a large change note whose value is a distinctive number that every later spend
  carries. **Notes cannot be combined**, so "insufficient" is reported against the largest SINGLE
  note - quoting the balance makes the wallet refuse while visibly holding enough.
  An exact-match branch was written and then DELETED: an exact match is by definition the minimum of
  the covering notes, so it could never change the result (no-unreachable-code rule).
  **Still open: the React screen itself.** The logic is done and tested; the presentation is not.

  **✅ THE CONTEXT PIN WAS ONE-DIRECTIONAL; NOW IT IS BOTH (8 tests, `relay.test.ts`).**
  `RelayContext.t.sol` already hardcoded the value TypeScript produced and compared Solidity to it -
  so it caught SOLIDITY drifting and was blind to TYPESCRIPT drifting, because it never runs any
  TypeScript. The other half now asserts the same constants from the wallet side. Both green
  together: `forge test --match-contract RelayContextTest` and `node --test src/pp/relay.test.ts`.
  This matters more than most: `context` is the ONLY public signal naming who gets paid, so a
  divergence costs a full proof generation and then reverts with ContextMismatch on submission, and
  `tsc` cannot see it because the TS ABI types are strings. Also pins what the context must BIND -
  recipient, feeRecipient, relayFeeBPS, processooor, scope - which IS the anti-theft argument in
  relay.ts, since a field the context does not move is a field a relayer can rewrite in the mempool.

  **✅ THE WITNESS HANDED TO THE PROVER IS NOW PINNED TO THE CIRCUIT (16 tests).**
  `withdrawWitness.test.ts` asserts the keys of `inputs` are EXACTLY `withdraw_identity::main`'s 17
  parameters, and that `pubSignals` is its seven public ones in declaration order. Noir binds BY
  NAME: a renamed or dropped key is not a TypeScript error and not a circuit compile error, it is a
  proof that never happens - so this is the same class of cross-artifact check as the lean-imt.sol
  fixture, pinned against the circuit source rather than against more TypeScript. Also covers value
  conservation into the change note, that the change note is re-derivable as
  `withdrawalSecrets(keys, label, k)` (get this wrong and the remainder is unspendable forever, with
  nothing saying so until the user comes back for it), and every refusal.
  **It consumes `stateProof.leafIndex` and `.siblings` from one object, so the StateTree fix below
  propagates cleanly** - that was the open blast-radius question and it is closed.

  **A NO-OP MUTATION, WORTH RECORDING.** Swapping the change note's derivation from
  `withdrawalSecrets` to `depositSecrets` changes NOTHING - all 16 still pass, because the two are
  literally the same function (pinned in notes.test.ts). That is not a test gap; it is the
  scope/label collision hazard demonstrated rather than argued.

  **🔴 A REAL BUG THE NEW TESTS FOUND: `StateTree.proof()` PRODUCED INVALID WITHDRAWAL PATHS.**
  It returned `LeanIMT.generateProof`'s siblings paired with the caller's TRUE `leafIndex`. Those do
  not go together: the library COMPRESSES the sibling list, omitting every level where the node
  carries up, and returns its OWN recomputed index for that compressed list - its comment says so
  outright ("the index might be different from the original index of the leaf").
  **The circuit expects the opposite.** `backend/circuits/pp/src/lean_imt.nr` walks all 32 levels
  from `leaf_index.to_le_bits()` and carries up wherever the sibling is 0, so it needs a
  LEVEL-ALIGNED array with an explicit 0 at each carry-up. Fed the compressed one, it walks the wrong
  pair order and reconstructs a root the pool never held.
  **Why it survived: the two agree exactly when no carry-up occurs - i.e. on power-of-two-sized
  trees. It works in the tidiest case and fails on most real ones.** Any withdrawal from a tree whose
  size is not a power of two, for any leaf with a carry-up, would have produced a proof rejected
  on-chain with nothing pointing back at the wallet.
  **Fixed** by building the levels from the public leaves and emitting 0 at each carry-up, plus a
  guard that the rebuilt levels reproduce the library's root.

  **THE TEST THAT FOUND IT IS THE ONE THAT DOES NOT TRUST ITSELF.** `LeanIMT.verifyProof` would have
  agreed with `generateProof` and proved nothing - the library agreeing with itself, the Go-testing-Go
  trap from NotaryRegistryProofTest. The path is instead walked by an INDEPENDENT reimplementation of
  the circuit's rule. And the suite now pins the CROSS-LANGUAGE fixture from
  `test_matches_lean_imt_sol_three_leaves`, a root whose comment records that `LeanIMT.sol`'s own
  `root()` was asserted equal to it ON-CHAIN - so the wallet's Poseidon is checked against Solidity's,
  not against more TypeScript. **12 tests; mutation-verified, including replaying the original bug.**
  (The rebuilt-root guard is deliberately NOT test-covered: it fires only if the library diverges from
  our rebuild, which no test can induce without breaking the library.)

  **✅ THE `pp/` TEST BLACKOUT, MEASURED AND CLEARED (2026-08-02).** "Fixed in passing" undersold
  it: SIX of nine `pp/` modules could not be LOADED by `node --test`, from three distinct causes.
    - **ethers type-only exports imported as values** (`ContractRunner`) - relay.ts, identityProof.ts,
      stateTree.ts. Node's type stripping erases `import type` but leaves a plain named import as a
      runtime import that cannot resolve. Same defect for the module's OWN interfaces
      (`MasterKeys`, `NoteSecrets`, `RecoveredNote`) in deposit/discovery/withdrawWitness.
    - **Extensionless relative imports** - ESM does not guess `.ts`. discovery, withdrawWitness, prove.
    - **A TypeScript `enum`** (`DepositMode`) - emits runtime code, which strip-only mode refuses
      outright. Replaced by a `const` object + union type; used only inside deposit.ts, so contained.
  **8 of 9 now load.** `prove.ts` cannot and never will under plain Node: `../sdk/circuits` reaches
  expo-file-system, which ships untranspiled TypeScript inside node_modules. It is a thin wrapper
  over RN native modules - device-tested, not unit-tested. **That is a real boundary, not a to-do.**

  **✅ FIRST TESTS OVER THE SPLITTING LOGIC (12, mutation-verified 4 ways) - `deposit.test.ts`.**
  Conservation, single-size uniformity, greedy minimality, and that the refusals actually fire.

  **🐛 AND A REAL DEFECT THE TESTS FOUND: THE NOTE COUNT WAS UNBOUNDED.** Uniform mode emits
  `value / unit` notes and EVERY NOTE IS A SEPARATE TRANSACTION, so a deposit that is a multiple of
  only the smallest denomination scales without limit - 1000.1 ETH is 10,001 transactions to sign.
  The greedy path is unbounded too (1e30 wei is 1e11 notes of 10 ETH). Unchecked, the wallet grinds
  for hours or dies allocating the array, leaving a PARTIALLY deposited balance. Added
  `MAX_NOTES_PER_DEPOSIT = 256` with an actionable message naming the denomination to use instead.
  **The check runs BEFORE allocation in both paths** - the counts worth rejecting are exactly the
  ones large enough to exhaust memory while being counted, so checking the finished array would mean
  building the array that is the problem.

  **✅ DONE (2026-08-02): `frontend/identity-wallet/src/pp/recipient.ts` + 12 tests.**
  `buildFreshRelayedWithdrawal(mnemonic, note, entrypoint, scope, fee)` derives the payout address
  and builds the withdrawal in ONE call, so the UI never asks the user where the money should go -
  the only safe design, since every answer they could give is linkable. Also gave
  `buildRelayedWithdrawal` its first caller.

  **THE PATH IS DEEP, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN.** The id is the note's nullifier hash, so recovery
  needs no stored counter - `discovery.ts` re-finds the note and re-derives the address. First
  attempt squeezed that into ONE hardened account index (31 bits), which collides at ~1e-4 over a
  thousand spends; the failure is silent and IS the linkage. The obvious repair - probe to the next
  free index - was BUILT AND THEN DELETED, because it makes the answer depend on the SET of known
  notes, so a newly-spent note sorting earlier can shift an ALREADY-PAID note onto a different
  address: recovery pointing where the money never went. BIP32 caps each LEVEL at 31 bits, not the
  path, so three levels carry 93 bits and the collision is ~5e-17 over a million withdrawals. No
  probe, no ordering, no stored set, and each withdrawal derives independently.

  **MUTATION-VERIFIED, and one mutation initially SURVIVED.** Setting the account to 0 - onto PP's
  master key - broke nothing, because recipients sit three levels deeper than the five-level reserved
  keys and cannot collide as addresses whatever account they use. The domain-separation claim is
  STRUCTURAL, so it needed a structural assertion; the address comparison could never have caught it.
  Four other mutations (dead level, narrowed truncation, unhardened segments, constant index) were
  caught as written.

  **FIXED IN PASSING: `relay.ts` could not be imported by `node --test` at all.** It imported
  ethers' `ContractRunner` - a TYPE-only export - as a value, and Node's type stripping leaves that
  as a runtime import that fails to resolve. **That is why nothing in `pp/` had tests.** Extensionless
  imports have the same effect under ESM, which is why the new module uses `./notes.ts`.

  **STILL OPEN: nothing calls `buildFreshRelayedWithdrawal` from a screen.** The addressing is
  solved; the withdrawal UI is not.

  **🚨 THE RECIPIENT ADDRESS IS NOBODY'S JOB (2026-08-02). Verified, not inferred.**

  **The wallet does not create a fresh address.** `relay.ts` takes `recipient: string` from its
  caller; there is no derivation function in `frontend/identity-wallet/src` (searched
  derive*Address/recipientAddress/freshAddress - zero hits). And `buildRelayedWithdrawal` has NO
  CALLER, so nothing drives a withdrawal end-to-end yet - the same class of gap as `Entrypoint.relay()`
  sitting unused before sec. 2.20.

  **Every ordinary answer a user has is wrong.** Their existing wallet is the linked address. An
  exchange deposit address is KYC'd. So today the pool's privacy rests on the user independently
  knowing to generate a throwaway key - and most will not.

  **THE FIX IS CHEAP AND THE MACHINERY IS PRESENT.** The root mnemonic is already there.
  `notes.ts` uses BIP44 accounts 0 and 1 for the PP master keys, so recipients need their OWN
  non-colliding range (e.g. `m/44'/60'/(1000+i)'/0/0`). Determinism is what makes this one-click:
  a fresh address per withdrawal is still recoverable from the same seed phrase, so "fresh" never
  means "another key to back up". Rarimo already owns that seed - this is the natural place for it.

  **THE TRAP ONE HOP LATER, AND IT IS ASSET-DEPENDENT.**
    - **ETH:** the fresh address receives ETH and can pay its own gas. Self-sufficient. Fine.
    - **ERC-20** (`PrivacyPoolComplex` exists, so this is real): the address holds USDC and ZERO ETH.
      To move it, it needs gas. Sending gas from any address you control **RE-LINKS IT** - the exact
      linking transaction the relayer was built to avoid, moved one hop downstream.
      **The relayer solves the withdrawal. NOTHING solves the first spend.**

  **THIS CORRECTS THE 4337 ARGUMENT BANKED ABOVE**, which framed it as replacing the relayer. That
  is secondary. The real case: a 4337 smart account as recipient, with a paymaster taking its fee in
  the WITHDRAWN TOKEN, means the fresh address never needs ETH at all - ever. That closes the
  ERC-20 dead end, which nothing else does.

  **⚠️ THE 5564 AND PAYMASTER "DECISIONS" WERE MINE, NOT YOURS - AND THE DOC CONTRADICTS ITSELF.**
  Below I concluded 5564 is "a non-requirement". But §3 STILL LISTS IT AS WORK TO BUILD (three
  places: the pure-TS/Solidity item lists, and the "removes the fresh-address problem" entry). Both
  cannot be true. Likewise task 22 was narrowed from "build an ERC-4337 paymaster" to "the residual
  case only", on the strength of the gas-stipend argument - **also my call, never yours.**
  **Neither was dropped by decision. Treat the argument below as ANALYSIS AWAITING YOUR RULING**, and
  retire the §3 entries only once you have made it. The argument may well be right; it is the
  unilateral settling of it, and leaving the contradiction in place, that is wrong.

  **THEY ARE NOT THE SAME KIND OF QUESTION, AND RULING ON THEM TOGETHER WOULD BE A MISTAKE:**
  - **5564 IS a genuine either/or.** HD-derived fresh recipients (`pp/recipient.ts`, shipped) and
    stealth addresses solve the SAME problem. Doing both is waste, so one of them should go.
  - **THE PAYMASTER IS NOT.** The gas stipend only works for a user who HOLDS AN ETH NOTE. For a
    user holding ONLY tokens, a paymaster taking its fee in the withdrawn token is the ONLY thing
    that helps — nothing else in the design reaches them. **So "residual" (task 22's current
    framing, also mine) UNDERSTATES it: that is a coverage gap, not a redundancy.** How much it
    matters depends on whether a token-only user is someone you intend to serve, which is a product
    question. Note it is not urgent either way: no ERC-20 pool is deployed
    (`PrivacyPoolComplex` has no operational deploy script), so this becomes live the day one is.

  **THE ARGUMENT: stealth addresses are the WRONG TOOL HERE.** ERC-5564 solves
  "a third party pays me without linking", via announcements the recipient scans. In a withdrawal the
  user controls both ends and knows the payout in advance, so plain HD derivation is strictly simpler
  and leaks less (no announcement to scan, no extra registry). 5564 would only earn its place if
  outsiders were paying INTO a pool identity. **Not a gap. A non-requirement.**

  **ORDER: recipient derivation first (small, unblocks everything), then 4337 for the ERC-20 spend.**

  **🗺️ LEAK INVENTORY (2026-08-02), ordered by how much they actually buy an attacker. Amount
  uniformity is NOT near the top, and treating it as the privacy story is the mistake.**

  **A. NETWORK LAYER - unaddressed anywhere, and it defeats everything above it.** Every on-chain
  precaution is void if one party sees your IP at both ends. Nothing in the wallet mentions Tor, a
  proxy, or per-session RPC rotation. The RPC provider sees the IP that scanned for notes and, if
  self-submitting, the IP that withdrew. **This is the biggest gap and it is not on any list.**

  **B. THE RELAYER sees a withdrawal before it lands** - recipient, amount, and the connecting IP.
  It cannot steal (context binds the payout) but it is a full deanonymisation oracle. ERC-4337
  would REPLACE this party rather than add capability - that, not UX, is its actual argument.

  **C. RPC BUCKET DISCLOSURE - documented and mild.** `discovery.ts` queries only the buckets your
  candidates fall into, which "tells the RPC provider which buckets you care about"; `scanAllBuckets`
  downloads everything instead. The comment is honest and the bucket is coarse and shared. **But the
  private option is OFF by default and the user is never offered the choice.**

  **D. AMOUNT AND TIMING - second-order, and only via SUM-MATCHING.** A lone withdrawal of 0.0731 to
  a fresh address links to nobody; it becomes evidence only once several withdrawals are ATTRIBUTED
  to one person and summed against a deposit. Attribution comes from A, B or C - not from the amount.
  **So amount uniformity is a defence against an attacker who has already won by other means.** That
  is the case for treating it as low priority on BOTH sides, and it is the user's read, not mine.

  **E. THE ANONYMITY SET** - at launch approximately one, and no defence works below it.

  **WHAT THIS REORDERS.** Deposit splitting (done), `Uniform`, `depositBatch` and withdrawal-side
  splitting are all attacking (D), the weakest link, while (A) is untouched and (B) has a known
  replacement nobody has costed. **Do A and B before spending another hour on denominations.**

  **🔬 ANALYSED FROM THE MECHANICS (2026-08-02): WITHDRAWAL-SIDE SPLITTING IS NECESSARY; DEPOSIT-SIDE
  IS NOT ONLY UNNECESSARY BUT COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. Two facts in the circuit decide it.**

  1. **Partial spend is supported.** `withdraw_identity/src/main.nr:123`: `new_value = value -
     withdrawn_value`, with a change commitment created. A withdrawal takes an ARBITRARY amount from
     a note, up to its value.
  2. **`label` is NOT a public signal.** The seven are `new_commitment`, `existing_nullifier_hash`,
     `withdrawn_value`, `state_root`, `state_tree_depth`, `identity_root`, `context`. **A withdrawal
     never reveals which deposit funded it.**

  **WHY WITHDRAWAL-SIDE IS NEEDED.** `withdrawn_value` IS public. Withdraw 0.0731 and that figure is
  distinctive on its own - no anonymity set contains it. Withdrawing only in standard denominations
  is what makes each withdrawal common. This is the half that is missing.

  **WHY DEPOSIT-SIDE BUYS NOTHING.** Given (2), a withdrawal of X could have come from ANY note worth
  >= X; the anonymity set is every such note, regardless of how its depositor arranged theirs. The
  depositor's own shape is public anyway (deposits are public by design), so uniformity across it
  hides nothing that was hidden.

  **AND WHY IT IS ACTIVELY HARMFUL.** Given (1), one large note can fund a withdrawal of any size,
  while N small notes CONSTRAIN each withdrawal to <= note value - forcing MORE withdrawals. So
  splitting deposits: costs N deposit transactions, then forces extra withdrawal transactions, each
  adding gas and another public `withdrawn_value` to correlate. It makes the side that actually leaks
  noisier in order to tidy the side that does not leak.

  **THIS INVERTS THE ✅ ABOVE.** Deposit splitting is marked DONE and defaults to ON. On this analysis
  the default is backwards. **VERIFY BEFORE ACTING** - this is reasoning from two code facts, not a
  measurement, and several adjacent claims of mine were wrong today. The way to falsify it: find any
  mechanism that links a withdrawal to a specific deposit. If none exists, deposit splitting should
  default OFF and `Uniform`/`depositBatch` both become moot.

  **🔵 `Uniform` MAY BE SOLVING A NON-PROBLEM - re-examine before building `depositBatch` around it
  (2026-08-02).** `deposit.ts:35-38` justifies `Uniform` by saying `Mixed` emits "9 + 9x0.1, a shape
  few others will share". But that is DEPOSIT-side shape, and **deposits are public by design** - the
  same error as the retracted timing argument above.

  Anonymity in this pool is **per-note at WITHDRAWAL time**: a 0.1 note withdrawn on its own is
  indistinguishable from every other 0.1 note in the pool, whatever else its depositor deposited. The
  depositor's overall shape is already public and cannot be hidden, so paying for uniformity across
  it buys nothing. On that reading `Mixed` gives each note the SAME per-denomination anonymity as
  `Uniform`, at 18 transactions instead of 99.

  **DO NOT ACT ON THIS WITHOUT CHECKING IT** - it is a reasoning result, not a measurement, and two
  of my adjacent claims today were wrong. The thing to verify: whether any withdrawal-side linkage
  actually consumes the deposit shape - e.g. if a user withdraws all notes together, or if the ASP /
  label structure ties a note back to its deposit transaction. If either is true, `Uniform` earns its
  cost and the fix is elsewhere. If neither is, `Uniform` can be dropped and the 99-note case
  disappears without needing `depositBatch` to rescue it.

  **🔴 THE 99-NOTE CASE, if `Uniform` survives that check: it turns 9.9 ETH into 99 NOTES
  OF 0.1** - which, given the sequential `submitDeposits` loop, is **99 transactions and 99 wallet
  approvals for one deposit**. That is not a rough edge; it is unusable, and it is the DEFAULT-adjacent
  path for any amount that is not a clean multiple. `depositBatch` is therefore not a nicety - without
  it `Uniform` cannot ship at all. It also sharpens the timing tension above: 99 notes with randomised
  delays is a deposit that takes hours.

- 🔴 **`Entrypoint.depositBatch` — SPLITTING IS A UX PROBLEM TODAY, and only a CONTRACT change fixes
  it (2026-08-02).** `submitDeposits` (`src/pp/deposit.ts:209`) is a sequential loop: per planned note
  it calls `entrypoint.deposit(...)` and then **`await tx.wait()`** before the next. So one 3.7314 ETH
  deposit becomes **N transactions, N wallet approval prompts, and N block confirmations in series** -
  a six-note split is six signatures and a minute-plus of waiting. That is not a client-side choice:
  **`Entrypoint` exposes only two `deposit` overloads and no batch entrypoint**, so the wallet has no
  other surface to call.
  **THE FIX:** `depositBatch(uint256[] precommitments, uint256[] values)` payable, requiring
  `sum(values) == msg.value`. One approval, one confirmation, and ONE 21k base cost instead of N.
  **It costs no privacy** - every note already comes from the same depositor address, so batching
  changes nothing an observer could not already join; it only stops the wallet paying N times for a
  linkage it never avoided.
  **WATCH THE LABEL NONCE:** the current sequential design exists because `label` derives from an
  incrementing pool nonce and the wallet must attribute labels to notes. Inside one transaction the
  nonces are still consecutive, so the wallet CAN predict them - but that must be verified against
  `_deposit`'s actual derivation, not assumed, or the wallet will mis-attribute every note in a batch.
  **Also preserve:** `usedPrecommitments` pre-checks and the refusal to swallow partial failure - a
  batch reverting whole is fine, silently skipping a note is not.

- ✅ **Denomination splitting — DONE 2026-07-27** (`src/pp/deposit.ts`). This turned out to be TWO
  gaps: the wallet had **no deposit path at all** — it could discover, prove and withdraw, but never
  create a note. Splitting is the DEFAULT, not an option, since a wallet that quietly deposits
  3.7314 ETH as one note has already lost the anonymity the pool provides. `allowRemainder` defaults
  to **false**: an inexpressible amount raises rather than silently emitting a uniquely-sized note,
  which would be a fingerprint on both deposit and withdrawal.
  **Honest limit:** the MULTISET still leaks — 1 + 0.1 + 0.1 is less distinctive than 1.3, but not
  nothing. Real fixed-denomination pools refuse non-multiples outright; that is what the default
  approximates. Deposits are submitted SEQUENTIALLY because `label` derives from an incrementing
  pool nonce, so concurrent sends would leave the wallet unable to attribute labels; a partial
  failure is reported rather than swallowed, since retrying blind would reuse a spent
  precommitment (`Entrypoint.usedPrecommitments`) and revert. Costs more deposit gas, which is an
  argument for fixing withdrawal gas (§2.4), not against splitting.
- **ERC-4337 paymaster** so the user never holds ETH. **NOT yield-funded** — see sec. 2.4c: yield
  belongs to depositors, not to a subsidy pool. Fund it from relay fees or protocol revenue.
- ~~**Stealth-address withdrawals (ERC-5564)**~~ — **DROPPED, and it was already answered elsewhere
  in this file (reconciled 2026-08-03).** The leak inventory settled it: 5564 solves "a third party
  pays me without linking", via announcements the recipient scans. In a WITHDRAWAL the user controls
  both ends and knows the payout in advance, so plain HIERARCHICAL DETERMINISTIC derivation is
  strictly simpler and leaks less - no announcement to scan, no extra registry. It would only earn
  its place if outsiders paid INTO a pool identity. **Not a gap. A non-requirement.** Built instead:
  `pp/recipient.ts`, HD-derived fresh payout addresses, three levels deep for ~5e-17 collision over a
  million withdrawals. This bullet survived as "open work" for days after the decision - a stale
  entry contradicting a settled one, which is how a closed question gets re-opened by the next reader.
- **Measure mobile proving time** — feeds §2.2.
- **Wire the stables leg of the SPV adapter.** `ISpvBasket` is declared but `SpvTreasuryAdapter` has
  no `BASKET` immutable — only ETH/Vogue exists. **Confirm the intended stablecoin is in SPV's
  deploy-time basket whitelist (`Aux.toIndex`) first** — an arbitrary ERC20 reverts.
- **Batch admission** — a postman admitting K identities per transaction saves per-tx base cost,
  though Poseidon hashing dominates. Modest (~5%).
- **`App.tsx` CONFIG holds literal zero addresses** for `stateKeeper` / `registerSimpleContract` /
  `poseidonSmt` / `holderRegistration` — the exact file to edit the moment anything deploys.
- **No backend endpoint produces a revocation signature** — `revokeDocument` takes it as a manual
  external input.
- ✅ **ECDSA Noir suites — THEY DO RUN, AND THEY PASS (verified 2026-08-01).** This item said "never
  been run, deferred as a cost issue". Wrong: `cd noir_dl_lib && nargo test` runs **80 tests in a few
  minutes**, of which **42 are `sigver::ecdsa::*` / `sigver::curve_*`** - all 8 curves
  (secp256r1/384r1/521r1, brainpool 256r1/384r1/384t1/512r1/512t1) plus the curve arithmetic. Every
  name is recorded in `backend/circuits/MIGRATION-BASELINE.txt`. There was never a cost problem;
  nobody had run them. **Nothing to do here beyond putting `nargo test` in CI.** (The recursive-proof suites are gone: `recursion.nr` and `bitcoin.nr` were
  both deleted as orphaned dead code, so there is nothing left to run there.)
- ✅ **Biometric-prompt UX fix — VERIFIED LANDED 2026-08-01, and it had introduced a hole.**
  The session cache is real and structural (`sessionMnemonic` at `root.ts:69`, short-circuited at
  `:76`, cleared by `lockWallet()`), not just claimed in a comment.
  **But it applied to the two operations that take the seed OFF the device.**
  `revealRootMnemonic` and `exportEncryptedBackup` both delegated to `getOrCreateRootMnemonic`, which
  returns the cache — so during any unlocked session the wallet would display all 24 words, or write
  a backup under a passphrase the *caller* chooses, **with no biometric challenge**. That is not one
  fraudulent transaction: it is permanent, silent compromise of the identity and every PP note, and
  it survives the user later locking the app. A passphrase is no substitute — whoever calls the
  export picks it.
  **FIXED**: both now go through `readRootMnemonicFresh()`, which bypasses the cache so
  `requireAuthentication: true` re-prompts, and throws the new `NoWalletError` rather than MINTING a
  seed when asked to reveal one that does not exist (the old path would have shown the user 24 fresh
  words that protect nothing). Ordinary derivation still prompts at most once per session — the UX
  fix is intact.
  **7 tests** (`src/identity/root.test.ts`, the first tests this module has ever had) count
  SecureStore reads, since a read is what raises the prompt. Non-vacuity proven by mutation:
  restoring the cache on those two paths fails exactly 4 tests and leaves the 3 UX-cache tests green.
  Run: `node --experimental-test-module-mocks --test src/identity/root.test.ts`.
- **Efficiency backlog:** Poseidon2 uniform swap, tree-depth tuning, public-input packing,
  shared-SRS reuse.

### 3a. Test-coverage inventory — what is untested, and whose it is (2026-07-27)

**Every contract in OUR fusion surface, and every one inherited from PP/0xbow, is now tested.** The
PP lineage is exactly five contracts — `PrivacyPool`, `State`, `Entrypoint`, `PrivacyPoolSimple`,
`PrivacyPoolComplex` — and the last of those had NO tests at all until today despite its constructor
changing twice in one day.

**Progress 2026-07-27: the crypto primitives are done — SHA1/SHA384/SHA512 and Date2Time are now
differential-tested** against Python `hashlib` / `calendar.timegm`, with the padding boundaries
(111/112/128 bytes) and leap years (2024 yes, 2100 no) that hand-rolled implementations get wrong.
All correct. **RSA, Bytes2Poseidon and BOTH PublicSignals builders followed — 22 remain.**

The builders were the highest-risk of the set: 23 and 24 signals written by hand-computed assembly
offsets (`mstore(add(ptr, 544), x)`) straight into the array a verifier consumes. A wrong offset
does not revert — it writes the wrong slot AND clobbers whichever signal really lives there. Every
index in both is now pinned with a distinct sentinel and read back as a whole array, so a COLLISION
is visible (a per-field test cannot see one — a clobber needs two fields observed together).

**TD1 is not TD3-plus-a-field.** 24 signals vs 23, and the layout genuinely differs: TD1 carries
birthDate / expirationDate / documentNumberHash / personalNumberHash / documentType as signals of
their own, shifting nearly everything after index 3. `nationality` is index 4 in TD1 and 5 in TD3.
Using the wrong builder compiles, runs, and produces a plausible-but-wrong array — the same TD1/TD3
trap that made the SDK's MRZ parser read passports at ID-card offsets.
`test_td1AndTd3LayoutsGenuinelyDiffer` pins the divergence so a future "simplification" cannot merge
them.

`PublicSignalsBuilder` was the highest-risk file of the set: 23 signals written by hand-computed
assembly offsets (`mstore(add(ptr, 544), x)`) straight into the array a verifier consumes. A wrong
offset does not revert — it writes the wrong slot AND clobbers whichever signal really lives there.
Every index is now pinned with a distinct sentinel, read back as a whole array so a COLLISION is
visible (a per-field test cannot see one, since a clobber needs two fields observed together). All
23 correct, and the constructor's ZERO_DATE seeding is pinned too — unset dates must not read as
0000-00-00.

`RSA.decrypt` is the 0x05 modexp plumbing every passport signature check runs through; verified
against an independently generated vector (Miller-Rabin primes, `s = m^d mod n`), including that a
tampered signature does NOT recover the message and that the output is exactly modulus-length — a
short buffer would misalign every subsequent digest read.

`Bytes2Poseidon.hash512` **discards the top byte of each 32-byte word** (`mod 2**248`, to fit
BN254's field), so inputs differing only there hash identically. Not a bug — a 256-bit word cannot
be a field element — but it means this is not collision-resistant over arbitrary 64 bytes, and it
must match whatever the circuit does or on-chain and in-circuit commitments diverge. Pinned, along
with the complement: every OTHER byte does affect the hash.

`Date2Time`'s `+2000` looked like a bug — a two-digit year always decodes as 20xx, so a 1974 birth
date would become 2074 — but it is only ever applied to `currentDate`, where it is right. Birth
dates never reach it: they stay encoded as bounds and are compared in-circuit.
`test_TwoDigitYearIsAlways20xx` pins that so the function is not later reused where it does not
belong.

**26 contracts remain untested, ALL of them rarime's passport stack**, not PP's and not ours:
`certificate/` dispatchers and signers, `utils/SHA1|SHA384|SHA512|RSA|Date2Time|Bytes2Poseidon`,
`registration/Registration2`, `sdk/PublicSignals*Builder`, `state/L1RegistrationState`,
`RegistrationSMTReplicator`.

**This is a DECISION, not an oversight.** They are vendored upstream code on the passport path, and
several (the SHA and RSA primitives especially) are the kind of thing that wants differential
testing against reference vectors rather than a smoke test — the same treatment `smt.nr` and the
curve gadgets got. That is real work and should be scoped deliberately. What matters is that the
line is now drawn explicitly: nothing of ours is untested, and this list is the exact remainder.

**Deleted rather than left looking healthy:** `WithdrawalVerifier.sol` and `CommitmentVerifier.sol`
(the superseded Groth16 verifiers — unreferenced after the Honk ports, and a stale verifier that
still compiles is a deployment hazard), plus `VerifierMock`/`FailingVerifierMock`, which nothing
instantiated once the proof paths moved to real verifiers, and a dead Groth16 `IVerifier` import in
`State.sol` implying a Groth16 path that no longer exists.

## 4. Decisions someone has to make

- **The ASP retroactive lever.** `PrivacyPool` now accepts any historical ASP root, safe *only*
  because the tree is append-only by construction. The same change under the old
  operator-published-root design would have been catastrophic — it would have re-admitted everyone
  ever removed and made removal a global no-op. **Accepting historical roots and predicate-bound
  revocation (§2.5) compose; either alone is broken.**
- **Single-seed SPOF — no recovery path.** One device seed derives both `sk_identity` and PP note
  keys; losing the device loses everything. `unforgettable-sdk` was evaluated and rejected
  (deepfake/liveness, four unanswered vendor questions). Deserves a native design pass. **Genuine
  product decision, not one to make unilaterally.**
- **Notary-to-address binding.** `bindNotaryAddress` is authorization-consistent but does not
  establish *how* a real notary proves identity. Ukraine's register verifies licensure only, not
  individual identity (that goes through Diia/BankID). A UK-solicitor-multisig PoA model was raised
  with unresolved cross-jurisdiction questions — **needs real counsel, not engineering.** Concrete
  suggestion from `TITLE-LEDGER-DESIGN.md`: reuse the passport flow for the notary's own identity,
  cross-checked by registration number against the registry.
- **Rarimo interop:** must this fork interoperate with the *live* Rarimo protocol (forces
  circomlib-Poseidon) or is it self-contained (Poseidon2-everywhere becomes possible)? Unresolved,
  and it gates the efficiency backlog.
- **PP SDK interop:** does byte-identical interop with the official Privacy Pools SDK matter, or is
  self-consistency enough? Related: `privkey % FIELD` in `notes.ts` is justified "by construction"
  but never checked against their real SDK output.
- **Test scope:** should the PP core Forge suite cover ERC20 (`PrivacyPoolComplex`) and `ragequit`?
  Currently only ASP-anchor-specific tests exist.

---

## 5. Blocked externally

- **SPV mainnet deployment.** `SpvTreasuryAdapter`'s immutable constructor params need real
  `Vogue`/`Basket` addresses. SPV has not deployed and has not picked a chain. When it does:
  re-verify `Vogue.deposit/withdraw` and `Basket.mint` signatures immediately before wiring (they
  matched at HEAD on 2026-07-26, but SPV commits daily), deploy `AaveCreditLine` with real Aave
  Pool/WETH addresses, and size the buffer/sweep/backstop parameters (still placeholder defaults:
  1 hour, 50%).
- **Android build** — no JDK/SDK/NDK here. `RnNoirModule.kt`'s `proveHonk` and `app.plugin.js`'s AAR
  path resolution have never been Gradle-built.

---

## 6. Parked — do not re-litigate without a reason

- **Card/BaaS/Rain/Baanx/EMI/KYC/MiCA/GENIUS compliance thread** — paused. Lives in
  `COMPLIANCE-THESIS.md` / `IDENTITY-COMPLIANCE-CARD-TODO.md` / `legal.md`. Includes abandoned
  money-transmitter research: `COMPLIANCE-THESIS.md` asserts the fleet/family-plan model "dissolves
  the large-purchase question" re: FinCEN 31 CFR 1010.100(ff)(5) — **treat that claim as
  unconfirmed** if the thread resumes.
- **EUDI Wallet Core native binding** — dropped as a hard dependency; format gap never resolved.
- **AirGap two-device / Knox provisioning** — dropped, would have been fully bespoke.
- **unforgettable-sdk** — dropped (deepfake/liveness). Still on disk, unused.
- **ILP / Interledger** — grant-funded side bet, not core roadmap.
- **Identity-bound PP withdrawal** — proposed then retracted; compliance is the wrong layer. The
  *soft* version (recovery-only label, never a withdrawal gate) stays a backlog idea.
- **companion/, vault/, qr-protocol/** — stale AirGap/card scaffolding, kept as reference.
- **Optimistic verification** — investigated, set aside. It does NOT trade away cryptographic
  soundness (the proof stays cryptographic, just verified lazily); it trades *immediate* finality
  plus a "≥1 honest challenger" assumption. Killed by two things: **a value cap is the only bound on
  worst-case loss** — without the chain checking the math, an unchallenged invalid proof withdraws
  whatever it claims — and **a bond does not fix it**, since an unchallenged theft returns the bond
  anyway. The bond must also come from a funded address, which is the linkage the pool exists to
  prevent.
- **EigenLayer AVS / Aligned Layer** — Aligned's verification layer is ~40k gas amortised but
  restaking-backed ("soft finality") and **does not support Noir/UltraHonk**; its aggregation service
  has real L1 finality but is ~300k gas and also lacks Honk. Both make our core cost structure depend
  on someone else's roadmap. SPV's own §W AVS anchors on the dead-man broadcaster for *liveness*, a
  different problem, and its docs warn against forcing other components in.
- **zkVerify** — a separate Substrate chain; Ethereum settlement needs its consensus **plus an
  authorized relayer plus a bridge**. Too much trust for a value-bearing pool. Ruled out ("no
  substrate").

## 7. Facts that will cost you time if you don't know them

**Toolchain traps — every one initially looked like success:**
- **`bb 1.2.0` + nargo beta.1 fails SILENTLY.** `bb prove` exits 0 and writes a proof that **bb's own
  `bb verify` rejects** ("Sumcheck failed!"). Anyone evaluating a bump by "did prove succeed?" ships
  a broken system. **Always run native `bb verify`.**
- **`--zk` is silently ignored under `--honk_recursion` on bb ≤ 0.87.0.** Two runs on one witness
  give byte-identical proofs — conclusive that ZK is off. Fixed on the 1.x line, where the flag
  inverted to `--disable_zk` (ZK now default). **Always run a two-run determinism check**, and clear
  output dirs between runs — comparing stale files once produced a false negative here.
- **Never judge a toolchain by `grep -c "^error"`.** nargo reports an ICE as a *panic*, so a crash
  that wrote no artifact reads as "0 errors". **Check the exit code AND that the artifact exists.**
- **`--oracle_hash keccak` is mandatory** for standalone on-chain verification; the default poseidon2
  transcript is for in-circuit recursive verification and its proofs revert `SumcheckFailed()`
  against generated Solidity.
- **nargo rejects non-ASCII in comments** — a `§` character breaks `nargo test` outright.

**Solidity / EVM:**
- **Higher `optimizer_runs` produces MORE bytecode**, not less. The ZK verifiers are ~24.5KB against
  EIP-170's 24,576; `optimizer_runs = 1` is scoped to the two verifier files via
  `compilation_restrictions` + `additional_compiler_profiles`, buying 1,007 bytes of headroom for
  +0.6% gas. **`via_ir` is deliberately NOT enabled.**
- **Verifier gas ≈ 2.38M + 3,510 × (public inputs). Circuit size is essentially free.** The
  irreducible precompile floor is ~568k (74 ecMul + ecPairing) — which alone exceeds UltraPlonk's
  entire 385k verification, so optimising UltraHonk cannot close that gap.
- **`bb` emits every generated contract as `HonkVerifier`**, and the ZK flavour declares it
  ` contract HonkVerifier is IVerifier {` (leading space) vs non-ZK `is BaseHonkVerifier`. The
  codegen rename handles both and hard-fails rather than silently leaving it unrenamed.

**Silent truncation — swept 2026-07-27, one real bug found:**
- **FIXED: JS `1 << v` in `Freedomtool.ts` vote masks.** JS number bitwise coerces to **int32**, so
  option 31 produced a NEGATIVE mask and option 32 silently wrapped to `1` — a vote for option 32
  encoded as a vote for option 0, with no error anywhere. Now `1n << BigInt(v)`. Every other bitmask
  in the codebase already used BigInt; these two sites were the exceptions. **Relevant to §2.7: the
  iran repo is a voting system.**
- **Checked and safe:** Solidity's flagged `unsafe-typecast` sites (`PoseidonSMT` tree height,
  `StateKeeper` expiration) each have an explicit `require(x <= type(uintN).max)` immediately
  before the cast. Noir casts in the PP circuits are `u1`/`bool` → `Field`, i.e. widening.
  `Number(...)` on timestamps/enums is within 2^53.
- **Safe only by contract enforcement:** `state_tree_depth as u32` / `asp_tree_depth as u32` in
  `withdraw_identity` truncate, and the circuit does not care (the value is used only in a bound
  assert, never in root computation). `PrivacyPool` rejects out-of-range depths using the full
  `uint256`. See §2.4 constraint 5 — this must be replicated by any other verifier.

**Client ↔ contract:**
- **ethers ABIs are plain strings, so `tsc` cannot check them against Solidity.** Removing
  `Entrypoint.updateRoot` left `identityAsp.ts` broken with **both** `forge build` and
  `tsc --strict` fully green. **Run `tools/check-client-abis.py` after any contract change.**
- **Do NOT index `_precommitmentHash`** to speed up note discovery. Exact-match queries tell your RPC
  provider which notes are yours. `PrivacyPool.PRECOMMITMENT_BUCKETS = 256` exists so wallets query a
  coarse bucket shared with many unrelated users; `scanAllBuckets` opts back into full scanning.

**Architecture:**
- **SPV coupling is one-way.** SPV's repo must contain **zero** references to PP; ibiza declares local
  interface stubs instead. Sharing *operators* is free (the batcher and any watcher can run on the
  same fleet); sharing a *repo* breaks the invariant. Batcher code lives in ibiza.
- **`Basket.mint`'s token acceptance is a hard deploy-time whitelist** (`Aux.toIndex`), even though
  its access control is permissionless.
- **`Entrypoint` storage layout changed** when the ASP tree moved on-chain. Harmless now (nothing
  deployed) but it is UUPS — once deployed, a change of that shape needs a migration, not an upgrade.
- **The identity-keyed ASP has a larger blast radius than upstream's label-keyed one:** revoking one
  identity blocks **every** note it holds, across every deposit.

### 2.18fa The ASP was never dropped — it was inverted and FUSED. The gap is elsewhere (2026-08-06)

**Correcting 2.18ez, which said the ASP set was dropped and should be restored as a required
predicate. It was not dropped, and there is no second predicate to restore.** §2.13b's title is
"INVERT the ASP" — a polarity change on ONE predicate.

**Approved-set membership and taint non-membership are the same predicate.** Over a fixed universe,
`label ∈ A` ⟺ `label ∉ T` when `A = U \ T`. They differ only in what INACTION does: an allowlist
denies by omission (fails closed), a blacklist permits by omission (fails open) — which is exactly
the argument §2.13b already makes.

**And the code already implements both with one SMT operation.** `circuits/pp/src/withdraw.nr`
calls `smt_verifier_full` with `SMT_INCLUSION` + `STATUS_CLEAN = 0`:
  - inclusion in the identity tree  = the approved set (proof-of-personhood)
  - leaf value == 0                 = not revoked (taint non-membership)
`IdentityRegistry.revoke:325-330` writes the predicate AS the leaf value, so revocation makes the
clean-status proof impossible rather than adding a row to a published blacklist. That ALREADY
satisfies the confidentiality constraint at §2.13b+ ("publishing the tree publishes the list"): the
tree is public, the reason is the leaf, non-membership is never stated.

**THE ACTUAL GAP is the other half of §2.13b's title — "keep PP's labels alongside".** PP's ASP is
over LABELS (deposits — money provenance); ours is over IDENTITIES (people). A clean person can
deposit dirty funds. `Entrypoint.sol:118-137` records that no admission path exists at all. OPEN.

**⚠ THE "SIGNER GATE CONTRADICTION" FILED HERE FIRST WAS A DUPLICATE OF §2.18g, AND WRONGLY FRAMED.
Struck, and replaced by what is actually new.** `IdentityRegistry.sol:207-217` already documents it
at the call site, more precisely: `register` is permissionless, but the document must already sit in
`registrationSmt`, whose writer `HolderRegistration` requires a backend signer's signature per user —
"the approval step still exists; it is one layer upstream of here." `:55-57` states the consequence:
**the trust root for "this is a genuine passport" is OUR SIGNER KEY, not the issuing state's.**

Three corrections to that first filing, each checked:
  - It is **not** a contradiction in §2.13b. §2.13b scoped its claim to the Noir path; §2.18g had
    already recorded the honest system-level scope.
  - The gate is **inherited, not ours**. `HolderRegistration` follows `RegistrationSimple`, a rarimo
    contract that verifies a backend signer. We chose that rarimo path over the other rarimo path.
  - It is **not an undecided binary**. The replacement is named and in-repo:
    `Registration2.registerViaNoir`, proof-gated against a certificates root built by verifying ICAO
    signatures ON-CHAIN.

**WHAT IS NEW, AND IT IS WHY THE REPLACEMENT IS STILL UNUSED.** §2.18g says "until a path like that
writes into the holder tree". Measured why it cannot today:
  - `Registration2` reaches the keeper via `stateKeeper.addBond(...)`, and
    **`HolderStateKeeper.addBond:186` is an override whose entire body is
    `revert("HolderStateKeeper: use addDocument (holder tree)")`** — deliberate, to stop the upstream
    1:1 binding being mixed with the holder tree.
  - The leaf semantics genuinely differ, so this is not a wiring task. Upstream binds passport→identity
    **1:1**. The holder tree binds document→holderRoot **many:1**, keyed
    `poseidon2(documentKey, holderRoot)` → `poseidon3(dgCommit, seq, timestamp)`
    (`HolderStateKeeper:369-375`). `Registration2`'s circuit has no `holderRoot` or `seq` to bind.
  - `onlyRegistration` is a **deployment-time enrolment of which CONTRACTS may write**, not a
    per-person approval — so it is NOT itself a censorship lever and must not be counted as one.

So removing our signer as the passport trust root costs **a circuit and leaf-format change on
`Registration2`, not a deployment change**. OPEN, and the size is now known rather than guessed.

### 2.18fb Checked against upstream: a one-slot substitution — and three orphaned ASP comments (2026-08-06)

**FIRST, THE LIMIT ON THIS CHECK, because it bounds every claim below: upstream PP is NOT VENDORED
in this tree.** No `.circom`, no `lib/`, no package dependency, and the earliest commit (0762975)
already carries our changes. The closest thing to upstream available here is that commit's
`ProofLib.sol`, whose accessors are still upstream's. Anything about PP's *circuit* is therefore
unverifiable from this repo and must not be asserted from the paper.

**WHAT THE CODE SHOWS — a literal one-slot substitution, confirming §2.18fa from structure rather
than prose:**

| | upstream (0762975) | current |
|---|---|---|
| signals | `uint256[8] pubSignals` | `uint256[7] pubSignals` |
| slot [5] | `ASPRoot` | `identityRoot` |
| slot [6] | `ASPTreeDepth` | gone — SMT depth is a compile-time global |
| enforced | `PrivacyPool.sol:59` `ASPRoot() != ENTRYPOINT.latestActiveRoot()` | `PrivacyPool.sol:110` `IDENTITY_REGISTRY.isValidRoot(...)` |

`ProofLib.sol:21` records the merge in the struct's own doc: "`ASPRoot` + `revocationRoot` collapsed
into one `identityRoot`" (§2.13k). Enforcement also got STRONGER on purpose — asked of the registry,
not the Entrypoint, because the Entrypoint is upgradeable and an upgraded one could lie about which
roots are genuine (§2.5a).

**⚠ THE FINDING: `Entrypoint.sol:315-332` IS THREE ORPHANED DOC BLOCKS.** `@inheritdoc IEntrypoint`,
an ASP-tree size accessor and an ASP-tree depth accessor, none with a function under them — the next
function is `:353`. One states a withdrawal proof "must carry" an `asp_tree_depth` public signal;
`ProofLib`'s 7-slot struct has no such signal.

**AND IT IS NOT MERELY DEAD PROSE.** The block reasons: "any root this contract has ever computed is
accepted, forever - safe ONLY because the tree is append-only." **The identity tree is NOT
append-only** - `IdentityRegistry.revoke` calls `_tree.update(commitment_, predicate_)`, so a
pre-revocation root still shows the identity CLEAN. That trap is already closed on the live path
(`IdentityRegistry.sol:35`; `isValidRoot:381` bounds acceptance by `MAX_ROOT_AGE`). So the stale
comment carries reasoning that, if ported to the identity path, would justify deleting the guard
that stops a revoked identity withdrawing. Delete the blocks; do not "update" them. OPEN.

### 2.18fc Upstream PP fetched from GitHub: the label plumbing SURVIVED, only the check was cut (2026-08-07)

**§2.18fb said PP's circuit was "unverifiable from this repo". That was the wrong conclusion - it is
not vendored, but it is public.** `0xbow-io/privacy-pools-core`,
`packages/circuits/circuits/withdraw.circom`. Fetched; quoted below from source.

**UPSTREAM, VERBATIM (lines 87-91):**
```
ASPRootChecker.leaf <== label;
ASPRootChecker.leafIndex <== ASPIndex;
ASPRootChecker.siblings <== ASPSiblings;
ASPRootChecker.actualDepth <== ASPTreeDepth;
ASPRoot === ASPRootChecker.out;
```
So the ASP leaf **is the label** - a DEPOSIT, not a person - confirmed from source rather than from
the paper. (An earlier draft of this line called the `LeanIMTInclusionProof` "genuinely an
ALLOWLIST". Struck - that conflated the data structure with the policy. See §2.18fd.)

`label` is PRIVATE: upstream's own `ProofLib` enumerates 8 pubSignals (2 circuit outputs +
6 public inputs) and `label` is not among them. Two independent artifacts agree, which is the control.

**AND IT EXPLAINS THE 8->7 COLLAPSE MECHANICALLY.** `ASPTreeDepth` is a signal upstream because the
ASP tree is a LeanIMT with variable depth (`actualDepth <== ASPTreeDepth`). Ours is a fixed-depth
SMT, so the depth is a compile-time global. The signal did not get dropped by choice; the tree type
changed.

**⚠ THE FINDING, AND IT MAKES §2.18fa's GAP CHEAP TO CLOSE.** Upstream binds `label` into BOTH
commitments (lines 62, 95) so provenance follows the money into the change note. **We kept that
plumbing exactly:** `withdraw.nr:80` `commitment_hasher(w.value, w.label, w.nullifier, w.secret)`
and `:99` `commitment_hasher(new_value, w.label, w.out_nullifier, w.out_secret)`, over
`commitment.nr:24` `hash_3([value, label, precommitment])` - structurally identical to upstream.

**Only the `ASPRootChecker` constraint was removed. The leaf a provenance check needs is already a
witness field and already bound into both notes.** So restoring fund-provenance screening is
ADDITIVE, not a rebuild: a root signal, an inclusion-or-exclusion check on `label`, and
siblings+index as private witness. It does not touch the identity path - it is a second independent
constraint on a value that is already committed.

**PRICE IT BEFORE BUILDING IT (rule 9), because the cost is NOT in the circuit:** a new public signal
takes `ProofLib` from 7 to 8 slots, which regenerates every withdrawal verifier and fixture, and
`PUB_LEN` is baked into the recursion-tree leaf commitment - so `BatchCommitmentLib`, both tree
circuits and both `TreeRoot{16,32}HonkVerifier`s move with it. That is a money-path change and gets
its own run with a falsifiable prediction (rule 10). Not started. OPEN.

### 2.18fd The allowlist/blacklist distinction is a LATENCY property, not a predicate one (user, 2026-08-07)

**The user's original claim was right and I twice drifted off it.** "Isn't approved-set membership the
same as taint non-membership" - yes, and 0xbow's own policy makes it so.

**EVIDENCE, from 0xbow's description of how the set is built:** they "monitor deposits into Privacy
Pools, conducting Know Your Transaction and **adding them to the Association Set if they pass
vetting**", and "previously approved deposits can be revoked". Vetting = screening for illicit funds.
So the RULE is exclusion; only the DATA STRUCTURE is inclusion. Calling the circuit "genuinely an
allowlist" because it uses `LeanIMTInclusionProof` conflated the two. §2.18fc corrected in place.

**THE ONE REAL DIFFERENCE - which side of the review window the funds sit on:**

| | approve-then-add (upstream) | list-then-exclude |
|---|---|---|
| unreviewed deposit | OUT, cannot withdraw | IN, can withdraw |
| operator must act to | let you out | stop you |
| who waits | the honest user | nobody |
| the race | none | tainted funds spendable until listed |

**`ragequit` IS THE PROOF OF THIS, and it is in our tree too** (`PrivacyPool.sol:371`, upstream at
the fork `:132`). A ragequit path only needs to exist if an unvetted deposit is STUCK - it is the
escape hatch for funds pending review. Its presence is direct evidence that upstream's operational
default is "out".

**WHY THIS ARGUES FOR THE EXCLUSION FORM IN OUR CASE SPECIFICALLY,** rather than being a wash: our
screening candidate is taint propagation over public transfer data (canonical, reproducible - see
§2.18ez), so our race window is bounded by how fast propagation RUNS. 0xbow's is bounded by a
vendor's human review queue, which is why the allowlist form is necessary for them and not for us.

**Therefore the cost of the exclusion form is the RACE WINDOW, and that is the number to measure
before building** - not "is a blacklist philosophically better". Nothing here is decided; §2.18fc's
signal-count price still applies. OPEN.

### 2.18fe One exclusion set for deposits AND identities — the primitive already exists (user, 2026-08-07)

**The instruction:** use the SAME set for identities as for labels (dedup). Same rule - if they pass
unflagged by OFAC, Interpol, and every list we can find, they are in.

**THE ENABLER, verified in code: `smt_verifier_full` ALREADY SUPPORTS EXCLUSION.** `pp/src/smt.nr:192-199`
takes `fnc: bool` alongside `old_key`/`old_value` - the circomlib bracketing-leaf signature, where the
adjacent leaf proves absence. `withdraw.nr:33` already names this: "passing 1 here would prove the
OPPOSITE". No new circuit primitive is needed.

**THE CONSEQUENCE THAT MATTERS: §2.18fc's PRICE DISAPPEARS.** If flagged entries live in the tree the
identity check already reads, a withdrawal adds
`smt_verifier_full(label, ..., fnc = EXCLUSION)` against the SAME `identityRoot` public signal.
Signals stay at **7, not 8** - so no verifier regeneration, no `PUB_LEN` change, `BatchCommitmentLib`
untouched, both `TreeRoot{16,32}HonkVerifier`s untouched. In-circuit cost is one more depth-32 SMT
verify, ~+11,856 opcodes (`withdraw.nr:26`), against tree nodes already running ~1.54M gates.

**THE CONTAINERS BOTH EXIST ALREADY:**
  - `IdentityRegistry.isPredicate` (`:128`) - typed exclusion reasons, registered up front, and the
    predicate BECOMES the leaf value, so the tree records WHICH list flagged an entry. "OFAC",
    "INTERPOL" are predicates, not new machinery.
  - `RegistrySourceAnchor` - already multi-list by `registryId` (`:160` `mapping(bytes32 => RegistrySnapshot[])`),
    already CRE-fed via `onReport` (`:334`), already emits `SnapshotLeaves` so anyone can rebuild and
    audit the tree. This is the ingestion path for "every list we can find".

**⚠ CONSTRAINT 1 - MERGING THE TREES MERGES THE WRITE AUTHORITY.** `IdentityRegistry`'s tree is
`CONTROLLER`-gated; `RegistrySourceAnchor` is CRE/forwarder-gated. Literally one tree hands the CRE
workflow write access to the tree that gates identity. That is a blast-radius change, not a refactor.
**Variant that keeps ONE signal AND the authority split:** two trees, public signal becomes
`hash(identityRoot, exclusionRoot)` recomputed in-circuit from two witness fields. Still zero new
public signals, still one check point, authority unchanged. NOT YET CHOSEN - and until it is,
everything downstream is ⏸️, not ✅.

**⚠ CONSTRAINT 2 - THE TWO SUBJECTS ARE NOT EQUALLY POPULATABLE, and this bounds the whole idea:**
  - `label` is chain-derived and canonical, so list -> label works by taint propagation. Automatable.
  - the identity tree's key is a commitment to `sk_identity`. **No sanctions list can produce it**, so
    a PERSON cannot be flagged from a list entry at all. The only document-side value that is both
    list-derivable and in-circuit is `dg1Hash`, and it is in-circuit at REGISTRATION, not withdrawal
    (`withdraw.nr` has no DG1).

**So it is ONE SET, ONE ANCHOR, ONE INGESTION - the dedup - but TWO CONSUMPTION POINTS:**
  - registration: prove `dg1Hash NOT IN set` (MRZ is in-circuit here)
  - withdrawal:   prove `label NOT IN set` + the existing identity-clean inclusion check
  - post-registration flagging of a known person: still needs `revoke` via CONTROLLER, because the
    list->commitment map does not exist and by design cannot.
The identity half therefore inherits the measured **23.3% MRZ coverage** and must never be described
as full sanctions screening of people.

**⚠ CONSTRAINT 3 - DOMAIN SEPARATION IS MANDATORY IF THE KEY SPACES MERGE.** Identity commitments and
labels would share one key space; a label colliding with a registered identity commitment turns a
non-membership check into a false DENIAL. Collision is ~2^-254 by chance, but the fix is one hash with
a domain tag at insertion and the failure would be silent, so the check earns its place (rule 3).

Nothing built. Decide constraint 1 first - it is the design decision the rest hangs off. OPEN.

### 2.18ff MEASURED: constraint 1 of §2.18fe is settled by gas, not by governance (2026-08-07)

§2.18fe left "one literal tree vs two trees under a composite root" as a design decision about WRITE
AUTHORITY. It is not a judgement call - **the merge is infeasible at list scale**, so the authority
question never arises.

**MEASURED** (`test/pool/AspTreeGasProbe.t.sol`, `forge test -vv`, LeanIMT `_insert`):

| inserts | gas | depth |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 69,221 | 0 |
| 2 | 98,029 | 1 |
| 16 | 144,423 | 4 |
| 128 | 235,277 | 7 |
| 1,024 | 327,717 | 10 |
| 4,096 | 396,785 | 12 |

~+30k gas per additional level. The OFAC SDN is ~17,000 entries (`SanctionsRootHashCost.t.sol`), so
bulk on-chain insertion costs **~17,000 x ~450,000 = ~7.65 BILLION gas, i.e. ~255 full 30M blocks**,
per refresh - and OFAC refreshes often.

**AND THAT IS A LOWER BOUND FOR THE TREE THAT ACTUALLY GATES IDENTITY.** `IdentityRegistry` uses a
fixed-depth-32 Poseidon SMT, ~32 hashes per insert against LeanIMT's ~14 at n=17k, so the real figure
is roughly 2x higher. The measurement kills the variant with margin to spare either way.

**CONCLUSION, and it removes a decision rather than making one:** flagged-list data must stay a
ROOT-ANCHORED SNAPSHOT - published once, leaves emitted for rebuild - which is exactly what
`RegistrySourceAnchor._publishSnapshot` + `SnapshotLeaves` already do. It cannot be an
on-chain-inserted tree. Therefore:

  - the exclusion set and the identity tree stay SEPARATE trees, so `CONTROLLER` and the CRE
    forwarder keep their separate write authority by construction, not by policy;
  - **the composite-root variant is the ONLY way to keep one public signal**: public signal becomes
    `hash(identityRoot, exclusionRoot)`, recomputed in-circuit from two witness fields. Signals stay
    at 7, so §2.18fc's verifier/`PUB_LEN` regeneration cost still does not apply.

§2.18fe constraints 2 (populatability: labels automatable, identities only via `dg1Hash` at
registration, 23.3% coverage) and 3 (domain separation) are UNAFFECTED and still open. Nothing built.

### 2.18fg The CRE ingestion path could NEVER have delivered a report — ERC-165 (2026-08-07)

**LANDED.** `IReceiver` implemented, `onReport` conformed, forwarder made replaceable.
489 tests pass / 0 fail; `tools/check-client-abis.py` green.

**THE DEFECT, and its shape is why it survived.** Chainlink: *"The KeystoneForwarder uses ERC165 to
check if your contract supports the IReceiver interface before sending a report."*
`RegistrySourceAnchor` declared `onReport` but never advertised the interface, so **the probe would
have answered false and no report would ever have arrived.** Nothing reverts. No event is missing,
because none was ever due. Every test in `RegistrySourceAnchor.t.sol` kept passing **because they all
call `onReport` DIRECTLY and skip the probe the real Forwarder performs first** - the tests exercised
the second half of a handshake whose first half was absent.

Note the selector detail that hid it: Solidity derives a selector from the PARAMETER LIST alone, so
the old `onReport` returning `(uint256, bytes32)` was still *callable* by the Forwarder. It is the
ERC-165 probe, not the call, that rejects a non-conforming receiver.

**THREE FIXES, all read off Chainlink's documentation rather than inferred:**
  1. `contracts/interfaces/registry/IReceiver.sol` - ONE shared declaration; `supportsInterface`
     implemented, overriding `AccessControlUpgradeable`.
  2. `onReport` returns nothing, per `function onReport(bytes,bytes) external;`. No caller could read
     a return value anyway - a report arrives by transaction.
  3. **`setForwarder` is replaceable.** Write-once was wrong, not a trade taken the other way: the
     address DIFFERS BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTS (MockForwarder to simulate, `KeystoneForwarder` in
     production) and `ReceiverTemplate` exposes a setter to move between them without redeploying.
     Write-once made the documented lifecycle require a UUPS upgrade - **and never bought what it
     claimed, since `OWNER_ROLE` holds the upgrade key, so the same holder could always re-point by
     upgrading.** It removed the cheap path and left the expensive one open. `ForwarderSet` now
     carries both addresses so a re-point is visible as a re-point.

**KEPT, AND DELIBERATELY STRICTER THAN CHAINLINK'S TEMPLATE.** Theirs is
`if (s_forwarderAddress != address(0) && msg.sender != s_forwarderAddress)` - an unset forwarder
accepts EVERY caller. Ours compares unconditionally, so an unset forwarder accepts NOBODY.
Fail-closed is right for a publication path; the template's default was not worth copying.

**ALSO CORRECTED: the "no Forwarder exists anywhere in this repository" note.** It concluded the
forwarder might be a plain EOA. That was a REPO-SCOPED SEARCH standing in for a fact about Chainlink -
`KeystoneForwarder` is a Chainlink-operated contract that validates the report's DON signatures before
calling `onReport`. Absence from this tree said nothing about its existence. Same defect class as
§2.18fb; the honest claim is now conditional on `setForwarder` pointing at the genuine deployment,
which must be checked against Chainlink's Forwarder Directory for the target chain.

**TESTS NOW READ FROM STATE.** They previously destructured `(index, root)` out of the call under
test - a value produced BY the code being verified. They now read `snapshots[registryId][index]`,
which is what any real consumer reads, so a publication that reported correctly and persisted wrongly
would be caught.

**RELEVANT TO §2.18fe/§2.18ff:** `backend/cre/sanctions_lists/main.go` already exists, so the
exclusion set's ingestion workflow is written. It could not have delivered until this change. Whether
it has an on-chain write path is NOT verified here and remains open.

### 2.18fh ⚠ THE SANCTIONS TREE IS NAME-KEYED — a dg1Hash check against it is VACUOUS (2026-08-07)

**This CORRECTS §2.18fe constraint 2, which said the identity half inherits "23.3% MRZ coverage".
That understated it and got the kind of failure wrong. It is not partial coverage. It is a type
mismatch that FAILS OPEN.**

`sanctions_lists/sources.go:605` — `leafHash(registryKey, s)` keccaks exactly four things:
`registryKey`, the source's own `Reference`, `Kind`, and `NameParts`. **No passport number, no DOB,
no MRZ.** `ListedSubject` carries nothing else (`sources.go:88-99`), and `Reference` exists precisely
because "a name is not stable at all (transliteration and alias ordering both vary)".

So the two key spaces are:
  - sanctions tree: `keccak(registryKey, Reference, Kind, NameParts...)`
  - identity side:  `dg1Hash = passport_hash(MRZ)`

**A proof of `dg1Hash NOT IN sanctionsTree` is therefore TRUE FOR EVERY POSSIBLE HOLDER**, sanctioned
or not, because no `dg1Hash` is ever a member of a tree of name-hashes. The check passes, costs
~11,856 opcodes, and constrains nothing. Nothing reverts; no test fails. Same shape as §2.18fg's
ERC-165 hole - a handshake against a counterparty that was never there.

**CONSEQUENCE FOR §2.18fe:** the unified exclusion set works for `label` (chain-derived, canonical)
and **does not work for identities at all** as currently keyed. Do NOT wire a `dg1Hash`
non-membership check against this tree. Options, none chosen:
  a. Give up identity-side sanctions screening; screen FUNDS only. Honest, and §2.18ff's measurement
     already says the fund side is the automatable one.
  b. Add a second, MRZ-keyed leaf per listing, populated only where a source publishes passport
     numbers - a genuinely different tree, and THAT is where a coverage fraction like 23.3% would
     apply. It does not apply to the tree that exists.
  c. Match on names off-chain and revoke via `IdentityRegistry.revoke`. Keeps the judgement off-chain
     and out of the circuit, which is where an unstable identifier belongs.

**RULE 3 NOTE:** if any `dg1Hash` predicate is ever added, it must be impossible to point it at a
name-keyed root. A non-membership proof against the wrong tree is the exact "silent, plausible-looking
failure" a guard earns its place against.

### 2.18fi Source authenticity is TLS-only, and nobody has joined TLSNotary to CRE (2026-08-07)

**Already conceded in-repo:** `sources.go:147` labels the posture `authenticityTransportOnly: the
publisher signs nothing. The only authenticity is the TLS` connection. Sources are the real public
exports - OFAC `SDN.XML`, UK OFSI `ConList.xml`, UN `consolidated.xml`.

**What CRE gives today:** `http.SendRequest` + `cre.ConsensusIdenticalAggregation`, i.e. N DON nodes
each perform their OWN TLS validation and must agree BYTE-IDENTICALLY. That defeats a single
tampering relayer. It does NOT survive an origin, CDN, CA or DNS compromise that every node sees
identically.

**SEARCHED, NOT FOUND:** no published TLSNotary-to-CRE capability. TLSNotary exists (`tlsnotary/tlsn`,
Rust; proofs of HTTPS content needing nothing installed on the server) and Chainlink publishes how to
author capabilities, but nothing appears to join them. ⚠️ **That is a SEARCH RESULT, not proof of
absence** - the same error this thread made twice about upstream PP and the KeystoneForwarder.

**AND BE PRECISE ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD BUY, because it is not source integrity.** TLSNotary proves THE
SERVER SENT THESE BYTES. Against a poisoned origin it would faithfully prove the poisoned bytes. It
upgrades "the DON asserts it fetched this" to "anyone can verify these bytes came from that host at
that time" - a real gain in AUDITABILITY, none in integrity. The primitive that would give integrity
is the publisher SIGNING its export, and OFAC does not.

**NAME COLLISION, recorded so it does not cost anything later:** `backend/cre/notary_registry` is
UKRAINE'S MINISTRY OF JUSTICE NOTARY REGISTRY - legal notaries - and has nothing to do with TLSNotary.
"We already did it for the notary stuff" refers to that. No TLS attestation capability exists here.

Both OPEN. Neither blocks §2.18ff's fund-side conclusion.

### 2.18fj The sanctions workflow parses NAMES and discards the one on-chain-checkable field (2026-08-07)

**VERIFIED, NOT ASSERTED.** OFAC's SDN publishes SANCTIONED DIGITAL CURRENCY ADDRESSES as ID records
whose `idType` reads `"Digital Currency Address - XBT"`, `"- ETH"`, `"- LTC"`, `"- XMR"` etc., carried
in the `idList` element (`sdn:idListType`). A maintained extractor already exists -
`0xB10C/ofac-sanctioned-digital-currency-addresses` - so per rule 8 this is a port, not a hand-roll,
and it doubles as the reference for the exact element path.

**AND `idList` IS A CONTAINER OUR PARSER DELIBERATELY WALKS AROUND** (`sources.go:243`, `:433`:
"OFAC nests `<uid>` inside an entry's akaList, addressList and idList, so a walker that [descends]
..."). `ListedSubject` carries `Reference`, `Kind`, `NameParts` and nothing else. **The addresses are
fetched, parsed past, and thrown away.**

**WHY THIS IS THE FINDING RATHER THAN A NICE-TO-HAVE.** Per §2.18fh the name-keyed tree cannot be
checked against `dg1Hash`. It equally cannot be checked against `label`, which is chain-derived. So
**the workflow currently anchors a root that no on-chain predicate can consume at all.** The address
field is the only one in the entire feed that lives in an on-chain key space, and it satisfies every
constraint the user has set:
  - CANONICAL - an address is exact bytes; no transliteration, no alias ordering
  - NO FUZZINESS - exact match, not name matching
  - NO THRESHOLDS - membership is a yes/no fact

**IT ALSO CORRECTS §2.18ez.** That entry said taint SEED ATTRIBUTION is "a judgement". For
OFAC-listed addresses it is not - the seeds are published, exactly and by name. Judgement enters only
at PROPAGATION (how far taint travels from a seed), which is a separate, later decision.

**THE JOIN, stated so nobody assumes it is direct:** an OFAC address is a DEPOSITOR ADDRESS; our
`label` is a per-deposit identifier. They are linked at deposit time - `Entrypoint` sees `msg.sender`
- so the chain is `sanctioned address -> deposit -> label`, and the withdrawal predicate stays
`label NOT IN taintedLabels` exactly as §2.18fe describes. Nothing about the circuit design changes;
only which field the workflow extracts and which key space the anchored tree uses.

**NOT VERIFIED, do not assume:** whether UK OFSI and UN SC publish crypto addresses in their exports.
Checked for OFAC only. If they do not, the address-keyed tree is OFAC-only and the other two remain
name-keyed and on-chain-unusable.

**CROSS-SOURCE CORROBORATION, since it was the original question:** there is NO shared identifier
across the three sources (`sources.go` has no cross-reference field, and `Reference` is each source's
own). Subject-level corroboration would therefore need NAME MATCHING - fuzzy, and ruled out by the
user. What IS available threshold-free: each source anchors its own `registryId` already (one list per
deployment), so composition is a CONJUNCTION the on-chain consumer chooses - "absent from all three"
or "absent from OFAC" - both exact, neither a threshold. Note the direction of the trade before
picking: "excluded if in ANY list" resists evasion but lets one erroneous source censor; "excluded
only if in ALL" resists censorship but any single listing is evadable.

OPEN. The parser change is the prerequisite for everything in §2.18fe.

### 2.18fk RESOLVED — a TLS capability is NOT needed, and the reason is the config hash (user, 2026-08-07)

**Conclusion: DO NOT build a TLS attestation capability. §2.18fi is closed on this point.** The user's
argument was that pinning the workflow already fixes the URL, so TLS is redundant. It holds, and the
joint it turns on is one this thread had not checked.

**THE LOAD-BEARING FACT, verified against Chainlink's documentation:** a workflow ID *"is a hash
derived from the workflow binary and configuration"* and *"changes whenever the workflow binary or
configuration is modified"*. **`Config.ExportURL` is therefore INSIDE the pinned hash.** This mattered
because `sources.go:223` deliberately does NOT hardcode the URL ("hardcoding one is a hardcoded
dependency on a publisher's URL scheme surviving"), so it was not obvious the pin reached it. It does.

**THE CHAIN, end to end:**
  1. `onReport` requires `reported_ == activeWorkflowId()` (`UnpinnedWorkflow` otherwise);
  2. `workflowId = hash(binary, config)` and config carries `ExportURL` -> **the URL is pinned
     on-chain**;
  3. every DON node runs that exact binary+config and must produce a BYTE-IDENTICAL result
     (`http.SendRequest` + `cre.ConsensusIdenticalAggregation`);
  4. a spoofed workflow, or the same workflow re-pointed at another URL, hashes differently and is
     refused.

**AND TLS ATTESTATION WOULD NOT COVER THE RESIDUAL EITHER - this is why it is useless rather than
merely redundant:**
  - poisoned ORIGIN: TLSNotary would faithfully prove the poisoned bytes. No help.
  - CA/DNS-level MITM hitting every node identically: it presents a VALID certificate, so a TLS proof
    verifies. No help.
  - single-node MITM: consensus already fails to agree, so no report is produced. Already covered.
  The only thing it adds is TRANSFERABLE auditability for a party who distrusts the DON - and such a
  party cannot trust the `onReport` delivery either, so it is moot for the on-chain path.

**WHERE THE TRUST ACTUALLY SITS, so this closure does not read as "nothing left to check":**
  1. **Who may re-pin.** `pinWorkflow` is `OWNER_ROLE`, append-only, and timelocked
     `WORKFLOW_ACTIVATION_DELAY = 24 hours`; re-pinning an already-named id reverts, so a contested
     version cannot be quietly re-armed. An owner CAN pin a new workflowId - hence a new URL - but
     only visibly and after 24h. Real authority, not a TLS problem.
  2. **Whether `forwarder` is the genuine `KeystoneForwarder`.** The repo's own test
     `test_anEoaPostmanForgesTheHeaderAndPublishesFabricatedLeaves` shows that against an EOA
     forwarder the metadata is SELF-ASSERTED and the pin constrains nothing at all. This is the real
     residual, and §2.18fg already made the guarantee explicitly conditional on checking Chainlink's
     Forwarder Directory for the target chain.
  3. **Publisher integrity.** OFAC signs nothing (`sources.go:147`). No transport technology fixes
     that; only the publisher signing its export would.

**NAME COLLISION, restated because it is what prompted the question:** the "notary stuff" is
`backend/cre/notary_registry` = UKRAINE'S MINISTRY OF JUSTICE NOTARY REGISTRY, legal notaries. It has
nothing to do with TLSNotary and needs no TLS capability; it is the same pinned-workflow shape as the
sanctions lists and inherits this entire analysis.

⚠️ Marked resolved, NOT ✅, per the closure rule: it is conditional on residual (2), which is a
deployment-time check nobody has made yet.
