"""Self-consistency checks on passport circuit parameter tuples.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `passport-profiles.json` recovers each profile's 14 generics from rarimo's published
artifacts and cross-checks them against that artifact's OWN abi - `dg1`/`dg15`/`ec`/`sa`/`pk` array
lengths must equal DG1_LEN/DG15_LEN/EC_LEN/SA_LEN/N. **That check compares each length to itself and
nothing else.** It cannot see a tuple whose lengths are individually plausible but jointly impossible,
and three published profiles are exactly that.

WHAT IT MISSED, twice, both found only when a build failed hours later:

  * `21_160_1_2_560_576_NA`, `14_256_1_4_1752_576_1_1496_3_512`, `1_256_1_5_2376_336_1_2120_4_512`
    declare DG1_SHIFT == EC_LEN, so `assert(dg1_hash[i] == ec[i + DG1_SHIFT])` reads past `ec`.
    0 of the 78 working profiles do this.
  * `20_256_3_5_336_248_25_2120_5_1816` places an AA key at AA_SHIFT with 2*32 bytes to follow, in a
    dg15 of 283 - eight bytes short.

Both are arithmetic on numbers already in the manifest. Neither needed a document, a build, or a
container to detect. THAT is the point of this file: these are cheap checks that run in milliseconds
and would have moved both discoveries months earlier, from "a 32 GiB build failed" to "the manifest
refuses to load".

⚠️ ONE CHECK IS DELIBERATELY A WARNING, NOT AN ERROR. `EC_SHIFT + HASH_ALGO == SA_LEN` holds for 76
of 78 profiles - strong enough to be worth reporting, not strong enough to reject on. A check that
fires on correct input is a clamp, not a check.
