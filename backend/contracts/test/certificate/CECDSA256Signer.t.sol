/*
 * The ECDSA half of the CSCA signature path (TODO.md sec. 2.18v).
 *
 * sec. 2.18s found a byte-order bug in the RSA-PSS signer and sec. 2.18u a forgery in the PKCS#1
 * v1.5 one - both in code nothing had ever exercised. The ECDSA signers were in the same state, so
 * they get the same treatment: a real vector, generated and verified by openssl before use, plus
 * negatives that would catch a verifier which accepts anything.
 *
 * THE CURVE CONSTANTS WERE CHECKED BY HAND against the published parameters for secp256r1,
 * brainpoolP256r1 and brainpoolP512r1 - all three correct. Brainpool's `a` and `b` share a long
 * prefix, which looks like a copy-paste error and is not; they are derived from one seed.
