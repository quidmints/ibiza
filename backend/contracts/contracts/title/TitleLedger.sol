///
/// WHY NOT the raw holder_root (Poseidon(pubkey(sk_identity))) used elsewhere in this fusion
/// (HolderStateKeeper, the PP identity ASP)? Because holder_root is one fixed, durable value per
/// identity - storing it directly as a title's public "holder" field would let anyone compare

/// each title stores `Poseidon2(holder_root, titleId)` - see pp/src/title_holder.nr - so
/// commitments for the same identity on different titles are unrelated field elements.
///
/// LOAN-COLLATERAL FLOW this is built for: a borrower calls `verifyHolderProof` (or a lender
/// contract does, off the borrower's proof) to confirm "the presenter controls this title,"
/// without ever learning who they are. The loan itself should be disbursed via a Privacy Pool
/// deposit using a precommitment the borrower generated locally (frontend/identity-wallet/src/

/// borrower by timing/IP/counterparty analysis. That disbursement-side wiring lives in whatever
/// lending contract integrates this ledger; it is not part of this contract.
///
/// OPEN GAP, not silently assumed solved: binding a real-world notary's identity to an on-chain

         *
         * WHY NOT A SALTED COMMITMENT, which was the obvious fix and was briefly built. Legal
         * descriptions - street address, parcel/APN, plat description - are low-entropy and
         * publicly enumerable from county records, so a BARE hash is brute-forceable and reveals
         * which real-world property sits behind a titleId. A per-holder SALT fixes that, and breaks
         * something a title registry cannot do without: with a random salt, two titles over the SAME
         * property produce two unrelated values, so DOUBLE-MINTING BECOMES UNDETECTABLE. A bare hash
         * at least collides. The salt bought confidentiality by destroying uniqueness.
         *
         * A keyed pseudonym gives both. DETERMINISTIC in the document, so a second title over the
         * same property collides and is rejected below. OPAQUE without the key, so the public cannot
         * run a dictionary against county records. And it adds NO new trust: the notary already
         * knows the document - they attest to it - so holding the key grants them nothing they did
         * not have.
         *
         * SAME PRIMITIVE AS THE IDENTITY REGISTRY'S revocation pseudonyms (sec. 2.13e), for
         * the same reason and with the same trade: a public set of opaque, deterministic values.
         *
         * It also removes the salt's custody failure. A lost salt makes a commitment permanently
         * unopenable - for a real property title that is unrecoverable. There is no per-title secret
         * here to lose.
         *
         * BINDING comes from the notary's signature over this value at mint, not from an on-chain
         * opening: whoever holds the document and the registry key can recompute it and check.
