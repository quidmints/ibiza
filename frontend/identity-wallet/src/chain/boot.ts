// Wiring the chain layer into the running app — the one place a transport or a signer is installed.
//
// Until this file existed the chain layer was INERT: `eth.ts` had no transport, `protect.ts` had no
// signer, and every read returned null while every write threw. Everything below is glue, and the
// glue is where two rules stop being documentation and become unbypassable.
//
// 🔑 **RULE ONE — ORDER.** `configureProtection` must precede `setSigner`, because the signer is
// bound to the relay at install time; reconfiguring afterwards would leave it broadcasting to the
// previous endpoint. `protect.ts` throws on that ordering, and `bootChain` simply does it in the
// right order so no caller has to know.
//
// 🔑 **RULE TWO — BIP-340 PARITY.** A local key is installed ONLY through `normaliseKey`, so the
// EVM address the app shows and the x-only key its taproot refund leaf commits to are two views of
// ONE normalised point. That rule fails for exactly half of keys if skipped, silently, months
// later — so the only path that installs a key applies it, rather than a comment asking callers to.
//
// ⚠️ **CUSTODY IS A CHOICE WITH A VISIBLE COST, NOT A FALLBACK.** `useLocalKey` gives structural
// MEV protection (we sign, we pick the endpoint). `useExternalWallet` cannot — Phantom and Ledger
// sign AND broadcast, so `protectionEnabled()` stays false for that session. Both are supported;
// the UI must render `signerKind()` rather than a static badge.
