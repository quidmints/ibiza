/*
 * ECDSA Active Authentication over brainpoolP256r1 (TODO.md sec. 2.18v, second site).
 *
 * This contract had the SAME low-s defect as the certificate signers: it handed the signature
 * straight to a library that accepts only the lower half of the curve, while passports do not
 * normalise. Roughly half of all genuine AA responses were refused.
 *
 * Both vectors are real signatures from one brainpoolP256r1 key over SHA-1 of the challenge, chosen
 * so one has HIGH s and the other LOW - the fix must repair the refused half without disturbing the
 * canonical one.
